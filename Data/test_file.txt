h, well," said sirius, "you made us feel ashamed of ourselves sometimes... that was
something..."
"and," said harry doggedly, determined to say everything that was on his mind now he was here, "he kept looking over at the girls by the lake, hoping they were watching him!"
"oh, well, he always made a fool of himself whenever lily was around," said sirius, shrugging,
"he couldn't stop himself showing off whenever he got near her."
"how come she married him?" harry asked miserably. "she hated him!"
"nah, she didn't," said sirius.
"she started going out with him in seventh year," said lupin.
"once james had deflated his head a bit," said sirius.
"and stopped hexing people just for the fun of it," said lupin.
"even snape?" said harry.
"well," said lupin slowly, "snape was a special case i mean, he never lost an opportunity to
curse james so you couldn't really expect james to take that lying down, could you?"
"and my mum was okay with that?"
"she didn't know too much about it, to tell you the truth," said sirius. "i mean, james didn't take
snape on dates with her and jinx him in front of her, did he?"
sirius frowned at harry, who was still looking unconvinced.
"look," he said, "your father was the best friend i ever had and he was a good person. a lot of
people are idiots at the age of fifteen. he grew out of it."
"yeah, okay," said harry heavily. "i just never thought i'd feel sorry for snape."
"now you mention it," said lupin, a faint crease between his eyebrows, "how did snape react
when he found you'd seen all this?"
"he told me he'd never teach me occlumency again," said harry indifferently, "like that's a big
disappoint--"
"he what?" shouted sirius, causing harry to jump and inhale a mouthful of ashes.
"are you serious, harry?" said lupin quickly. "he's stopped giving you lessons?"
"yeah," said harry, surprised at what he considered a great over-reaction. "but it's okay, i don't
care, it's a bit of a relief to tell you the -"
"i'm coming up there to have a word with snape!" said sirius forcefully, and he actually made to stand up, but lupin wrenched him back down again.
"if anyone's going to tell snape it will be me!" he said firmly. "but harry, first of all, you're to
go back to snape and tell him that on no account is he to stop giving you lessons -- when
dumbledore hears -"
"i can't tell him that, he'd kill me!" said harry, outraged. "you didn't see him when we got out of the pensieve."
"harry there is nothing so important as you learning occlumency!" said lupin sternly. "do you
understand me? nothing!"
"okay, okay," said harry, thoroughly discomposed, not to mention annoyed. "i'll... i'll try and say something to him... but it won't be-"
he fell silent. he could hear distant footsteps.
"is that kreacher coming downstairs?"
"no," said sirius, glancing behind him. "it must be somebody your end." harrys heart skipped
several beats.
"i'd better go!" he said hastily and pulled his head backwards out of the grimmauld place fire. for a moment his head seemed to be revolving on his shoulders, then he found himself kneeling in front of umbridge's fire with it firmly back on and watching the emerald flames flicker and die.
"quickly, quickly!" he heard a wheezy voice mutter right outside the office door. "ah, she's left
it open -"
harry dived for the invisibility cloak and had just managed to pull it back over himself when
filch burst into the office. he looked absolutely delighted about something and was talking to
himself feverishly as he crossed the room, pulled open a drawer in umbridge's desk and began
rifling through the papers inside it.
"approval for whipping... approval for whipping... i can do it at last... they've had it coming
to them for years..."
he pulled out a piece of parchment, kissed it, then shuffled rapidly back out of the door,
clutching it to his chest.
harry leapt to his feet and, making sure he had his bag and that the invisibility cloak was
completely covering him, he wrenched open the door and hurried out of the office after filch,
who was hobbling along faster than harry had ever seen him go.
one landing down from umbridge's office, harry thought it was safe to become visible again.
he pulled off the cloak, shoved it in his bag and hurried onwards. there was a great deal of
shouting and movement coming from the entrance hall. he ran down the marble staircase and
found what looked like most of the school assembled there.
it was just like the night when trelawney had been sacked. students were standing all around the
walls in a great ring (some of them, harry noticed, covered in a substance that looked very like
stinksap); teachers and ghosts were also in the crowd. prominent among the onlookers were
members of the inquisitorial squad, who were all looking exceptionally pleased with themselves,
and peeves, who was bobbing overhead, gazed down at fred and george who stood in the
middle of the floor with the unmistakable look of two people who had just been cornered.
"so!" said umbridge triumphantly. harry realized she was standing just a few stairs in front of
him, once more looking down upon her prey. "so - you think it amusing to turn a school corridor
into a swamp, do you?"
"pretty amusing, yeah," said fred, looking up at her without the slightest sign of fear.
filch elbowed his way closer to umbridge, almost crying with happiness.
"i've got the form, headmistress," he said hoarsely, waving the piece of parchment harry had
just seen him take from her desk. "i've got the form and i've got the whips waiting... oh, let me
do it now..."
"very good, argus," she said. "you two," she went on, gazing down at fred and george, "are
about to learn what happens to wrongdoers in my school."
"you know what?" said fred. "i don't think we are."
he turned to his twin.
"george," said fred, "i think we've outgrown full-time education."
"yeah, i've been feeling that way myself," said george lightly.
"time to test our talents in the real world, d'you reckon?" asked fred.
"definitely," said george.
and before umbridge could say a word, they raised their wands and said together:
"accio brooms!"
harry heard a loud crash somewhere in the distance. looking to his left, he ducked just in time.
fred and george's broomsticks, one still trailing the heavy chain and iron peg with which
umbridge had fastened them to the wall, were hurtling along the corridor towards their owners;
they turned left, streaked down the stairs and stopped sharply in front of the twins, the chain
clattering loudly on the flagged stone floor.
"we won't be seeing you," fred told professor umbridge, swinging his leg over his broomstick.
"yeah, don't bother to keep in touch," said george, mounting his own.
fred looked around at the assembled students, at the silent, watchful crowd.
"if anyone fancies buying a portable swamp, as demonstrated upstairs, come to number ninety-three, diagon alley - weasleys' wizarding wheezes," he said in a loud voice. "our new
premises!"
"special discounts to hogwarts students who swear they're going to use our products to get rid of this old bat," added george, pointing at professor umbridge.
"stop them!" shrieked umbridge, but it was too late. as the inquisitorial squad closed in,
fred and george kicked off from the floor, shooting fifteen feet into the air, the iron peg
swinging dangerously below. fred looked across the hall at the poltergeist bobbing on his level
above the crowd.
"give her hell from us, peeves."
and peeves, who harry had never seen take an order from a student before, swept his belled hat
from his head and sprang to a salute as fred and george wheeled about to tumultuous applause
from the students below and sped out of the open front doors into the glorious sunset.
chapter thirty
grawp
the story of fred and george's flight to freedom was retold so often over the next few days that
harry could tell it would soon become the stuff of hogwarts legend: within a week, even those
who had been eye-witnesses were half-convinced they had seen the twins dive-bomb umbridge
on their brooms and pelt her with dungbombs before zooming out of the doors. in the immediate
aftermath of their departure there was a great wave of talk about copying them. harry frequently
heard students saying things like, "honestly some days i just feel like jumping on my broom and
leaving this place," or else, "one more lesson like that and i might just do a weasley."
fred and george had made sure nobody was likely to forget them too soon. for one thing, they
had not left instructions on how to remove the swamp that now filled the corridor on the fifth
floor of the east wing. umbridge and filch had been observed trying different means of
removing it but without success. eventually the area was roped off and filch, gnashing his teeth
furiously, was given the task of punting students across it to their classrooms. harry was certain
that teachers like mcgonagall or flitwick could have removed the swamp in an instant but, just
as in the case of fred and georges wildfire whiz-bangs, they seemed to prefer to watch
umbridge struggle.
then there were the two large broom-shaped holes in umbridge's office door, through which
fred and george's cleansweeps had smashed to rejoin their masters. filch fitted a new door and
removed harry's firebolt to the dungeons where, it was rumored, umbridge had set an armed
security troll to guard it. however, her troubles were far from over.
inspired by fred and george's example, a great number of students were now vying for the
newly vacant positions of troublemakers-in-chief. in spite of the new door, somebody managed
to slip a hairy-snouted niffler into umbridge's office, which promptly tore the place apart in its
search for shiny objects, leapt on umbridge when she entered and tried to gnaw the rings off her
stubby fingers. dungbombs and stink pellets were dropped so frequently in the corridors that it
became the new fashion for students to perform bubble-head charms on themselves before
leaving lessons, wowhere to be seen and for a moment harry thought the worst, but then there was a loud bang and a flash of red light, and the snake flew into the air, smacking harry hard in the face as it went, coil after heavy coil rising up to the ceiling. harry raised his wand, but as he did so, his scar seared more painfully, more powerfully than it had done in years. "he's coming! hermione, he's coming!" as he yelled the snake fell, hissing wildly. everything was chaos: it smashed shelves from the wall, and splintered china flew everywhere as harry jumped over the bed and seized the dark shape he knew to be hermione -- she shrieked with pain as he pulled her back across the bed: the snake reared again, but harry knew that worse than the snake was coming, was perhaps already at the gate, his head was going to split open with the pain from his scar -- the snake lunged as he took a running leap, dragging hermione with him; as it struck, hermione screamed, "confringo!" and her spell flew around the room, exploding the wardrobe mirror and ricocheting back at them, bouncing from floor to ceiling; harry felt the heat of it sear the back of his hand. glass cut his cheek as, pulling hermione with him, he leapt from bed to broken dressing table and then straight out of the smashed window
into nothingness, her scream reverberating through the night as they twisted in midair ... and then his scar burst open and he was voldemort and he was running across the fetid bedroom, his long white hands clutching at the windowsill as he glimpsed the bald man and the little woman twist and vanish, and he screamed with rage, a scream that mingled with the girl's, that echoed across the dark gardens over the church bells ringing in christmas day... and his scream was harry's scream, his pain was harry's pain... that it could happen here, where it had happened before... here, within sight of that house where he had come so close to knowing what it was to die ... to die ... the pain was so terrible ... ripped from his body ... but if he had no body, why did his head hurt so badly; if he was dead, how cold he feel so unbearably, didn't pain cease with death, didn't it go ... the night wet and windy, two children dressed as pumpkins waddling across the square and the shop windows covered in paper spiders, all the tawdry muggle trappings of a world in which they did not believe ... and he was gliding along, that sense of purpose and power and rightness in him that he always knew on these occasions ... not anger ... that was for weaker souls than he ... but triumph, yes ... he had waited for this, he had hoped for it ... "nice costume, mister!" he saw the small boy's smile falter as he ran near enough to see beneath the hood of the cloak, saw the fear cloud his pained face: then the child turned and ran away ... beneath the robe he fingered the handle of his wand ... one simple movement and the child would never reach his mother ... but unnecessary, quite unnecessary ... and along a new and darker street he moved, and now his destination was in sight at last, the fidelius charm broken, though they did not know it yet ... and he made less noise than the dead leaves slithering along the pavement as he drew level with the dark hedge, and steered over it ... they had not drawn the curtains; he saw them quite clearly in their little sitting room, the tall black-haired man in his glasses, making puffs of colored smoke erupt from his wand for the amusement of the small black-haired boy in his blue pajamas. the child was laughing and trying to catch the smoke, to grab it in his small fist ... a door opened and the mother entered, saying words he cold not hear, her long dark-red hair falling over her face. now the father scooped up the son and handed him to the mother. he threw his wand down upon the sofa and stretched, yawning... the gate creaked a little as he pushed it open, but james potter did not hear. his white hand pulled out the wand beneath his cloak and pointed it at the door, which burst open... he was over the threshold as james came sprinting into the hall. it was easy, too easy, he
had not even picked up his wand ... "lily, take harry and go! it's him! go! run! i'll hold him off!" hold him off, without a wand in his hand! ... he laughed before casting the curse ... "avada kedavra!" the green light filled the cramped hallway, it lit the pram pushed against the wall, it made the banisters glow like lighting rods, and james potter fell like a marionette whose strings were cut ... he could hear her screaming from the upper floor, trapped, but as long as she was sensible, she, at least, had nothing to fear ... he climbed the steps, listening with faint amusement to her attempts to barricade herself in ... she had no wand upon her either ... how stupid they were, and how trusting, thinking that their safety lay in friends, that weapons could be discarded even for moments... he forced the door open, cast aside the chair and boxes hastily piled against it with one lazy wave of his wand ... and there she stood, the child in her arms. at the sight of him, she dropped her son into the crib behind her and threw her arms wide, as if this would help, as if in shielding him from sight she hoped to be chosen instead ... "not harry, not harry, please not harry!" "stand aside, you silly girl... stand aside, now." "not harry, please no, take me, kill me instead --" "this is my last warning --" "not harry! please ... have mercy ... have mercy ... not harry! not harry! please -- i'll do anything ..." "stand aside. stand aside, girl!" he could have forced her away from the crib, but it seemed more prudent to finish them all ... the green light flashed around the room and she dropped like her husband. the child had not cried all this time. he could stand, clutching the bars of his crib, and he looked up into the intruder's face with a kind of bright interest, perhaps thinking that it was his father who hid beneath the cloak, making more pretty lights, and his mother would pop up any moment, laughing -- he pointed the wand very carefully into the boy's face: he wanted to see it happen, the
destruction of this one, inexplicable danger. the child began to cry: it had seen that he was not james. he did not like it crying, he had never been able to stomach the small ones whining in the orphanage -- "avada kedavra!" and then he broke. he was nothing, nothing but pain and terror, and he must hide himself, not here in the rubble of the ruined house, where the child was trapped screaming, but far away ... far away ... "no," he moaned. the snake rustled on the filthy, cluttered floor, and he had killed the boy, and yet he was the boy ... "no..." and now he stood at the broken window of bathilda's house, immersed in memories of his greatest loss, and at his feet the great snake slithered over broken china and glass... he looked down and saw something... something incredible... "no..." "harry, it's all right, you're all right!" he stooped down and picked up the smashed photograph. there he was, the unknown thief, the thief he was seeking... "no... i dropped it... i dropped it ..." "harry, it's okay, wake up, wake up!" he was harry... harry, not voldemort ... and the thing that was rustling was not a snake ... he opened his eyes. "harry," hermione whispered. "do you feel all -- all right?" "yes," he lied. he was in the tent, lying on one of the lower bunks beneath a heap of blankets. he could tell that it was almost dawn by the stillness and quality of the cold, flat light beyond the canvas ceiling. he was drenched in sweat; he could feel it on the sheets and blankets. "we got away." "yes," said hermione. "i had to use a hover charm to get you into your bunk. i couldn't
lift you. you've been ... well, you haven't been quite ..." there were purple shadows under her brown eyes and he noticed a small sponge in her hand: she had been wiping his face. "you've been ill," she finished. "quite ill." "how long ago did we leave?" "hours ago. it's nearly morning." "and i've been... what, unconscious?" "not exactly," said hermione uncomfortably. "you've been shouting and moaning and ... things," she added in a tone that made harry feel uneasy. what had he done? screamed curses like voldemort, cried like the baby in the crib? "i couldn't get the horcrux off you," hermione said, and he knew she wanted to change the subject. "it was stuck, stuck to your chest. you've got a mark; i'm sorry, i had to use a severing charm to get it away. the snake hit you too, but i've cleaned the wound and put some dittany on it ..." he pulled the sweaty t-shirt he was wearing away from himself and looked down. there was a scarlet oval over his heart where the locket had burned him. he could also see the half healed puncture marks to his forearm. "where've you put the horcrux?" "in my bag. i think we should keep it off for a while." he lay back on his pillows and looked into her pinched gray face. "we shouldn't have gone to godric's hollow. it's my fault, it's all my fault. hermione, i'm sorry." "it's not you fault. i wanted to go too; i really thought dumbledore might have left the sword there for you." "yeah, well ... we got that wrong, didn't we?" "what happened, harry? what happened when she took you upstairs? was the snake hiding somewhere? did it just come out and kill her and attack you?" "no." he said. "she was the snake ... or the snake was her ... all along." "w-what?"
he closed his eyes. he could still smell bathilda's house on him; it made the whole thing horribly vivid. "bathilda must've been dead a while. the snake was ... was inside her. you-know-who put it there in godric's hollow, to wait. you were right. he knew i'd go back." "the snake was inside her?" he opened his eyes again. hermione looked revolted, nauseated. "lupin said there would be magic we'd never imagined." harry said. "she didn't want to talk in front of you, because it was parseltongue, all parseltongue, and i didn't realize, but of professor mcgonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. "really, dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? these people will never understand him! he'll be famous -- a legend -- i wouldn't be surprised if today was known as harry potter day in the future -- there will be books written about harry -- every child in our world will know his name!" 

"exactly," said dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses. "it would be enough to turn any boy's head. famous before he can walk and talk! famous for something he won't even remember! cara you see how much better off he'll be, growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it?" 

professor mcgonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, "yes -- yes, you're right, of course. but how is the boy getting here, dumbledore?" she eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding harry underneath it. 

"hagrid's bringing him." 

"you think it -- wise -- to trust hagrid with something as important as this?" 

i would trust hagrid with my life," said dumbledore. 

"i'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place," said professor mcgonagall grudgingly, "but you can't pretend he's not careless. he does tend to -- what was that?" 

a low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. it grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky -- and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them. 

if the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. he was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. he looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild - long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. in his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets. 

"hagrid," said dumbledore, sounding relieved. "at last. and where did you get that motorcycle?" 

"borrowed it, professor dumbledore, sit," said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. "young sirius black lent it to me. i've got him, sir." 

"no problems, were there?" 

"no, sir -- house was almost destroyed, but i got him out all right before the muggles started swarmin' around. he fell asleep as we was flyin' over bristol." 

dumbledore and professor mcgonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning. 

"is that where -?" whispered professor mcgonagall. 

"yes," said dumbledore. "he'll have that scar forever." 

"couldn't you do something about it, dumbledore?" 

"even if i could, i wouldn't. scars can come in handy. i have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the london underground. well -- give him here, hagrid -- we'd better get this over with." 

dumbledore took harry in his arms and turned toward the dursleys' house. 

"could i -- could i say good-bye to him, sir?" asked hagrid. he bent his great, shaggy head over harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. then, suddenly, hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog. 

"shhh!" hissed professor mcgonagall, "you'll wake the muggles!" 

"s-s-sorry," sobbed hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. "but i c-c-can't stand it -- lily an' james dead -- an' poor little harry off ter live with muggles -" 

"yes, yes, it's all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, hagrid, or we'll be found," professor mcgonagall whispered, patting hagrid gingerly on the arm as dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. he laid harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside harry's blankets, and then came back to the other two. for a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; hagrid's shoulders shook, professor mcgonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out. 

"well," said dumbledore finally, "that's that. we've no business staying here. we may as well go and join the celebrations." 

"yeah," said hagrid in a very muffled voice, "i'll be takin' sirius his bike back. g'night, professor mcgonagall -- professor dumbledore, sir." 

wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night. 

"i shall see you soon, i expect, professor mcgonagall," said dumbledore, nodding to her. professor mcgonagall blew her nose in reply. 

dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. on the corner he stopped and took out the silver put-outer. he clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that privet drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. he could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four. 

"good luck, harry," he murmured. he turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone. 

a breeze ruffled the neat hedges of privet drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. harry potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. one small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by mrs. dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin dudley... he couldn't know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: "to harry potter -- the boy who lived!" 

chapter two 

the vanishing glass 

nearly ten years had passed since the dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but privet drive had hardly changed at all. the sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the dursleys' front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when mr. dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. 

ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets -- but dudley dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. 

the room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too. 

yet harry potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. his aunt petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day. 

"up! get up! now!" 

harry woke with a start. his aunt rapped on the door again. 

"up!" she screeched. harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. he rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. it had been a good one. there had been a flying motorcycle in it. he had a funny feeling he'd had the same dream before. 

his aunt was back outside the door. 

"are you up yet?" she demanded. 

"nearly," said harry. 

"well, get a move on, i want you to look after the bacon. and don't you dare let it burn, i want everything perfect on duddy's birthday." 

harry groaned. 

"what did you say?" his aunt snapped through the door. 

"nothing, nothing..." 

dudley's birthday -- how could he have forgotten? harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. he found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. 

when he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. the table was almost hidden beneath all dudley's birthday presents. it looked as though dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. exactly why dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to harry, as dudley was very fat and hated exercise -- unless of course it involved punching somebody. dudley's favorite punching bag was harry, but he couldn't often catch him. harry didn't look it, but he was very fast. 

perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but harry had always been small and skinny for his age. he looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of dudley's, and dudley was about four times bigger than he was. harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. he wore round glasses held together with a lot of scotch tape because of all the times dudley had punched him on the nose. the only thing harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. he had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his aunt petunia was how he had gotten it. 

"in the car crash when your parents died," she had said. "and don't ask questions." 

don't ask questions -- that was the first rule for a quiet life with the dursleys. 

uncle vernon entered the kitchen as harry was turning over the bacon. 

"comb your hair!" he barked, by way of a morning greeting. 

about once a week, uncle vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that harry needed a haircut. harry must havangs. 

it was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and harry knew that the only reason they weren't already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant. 

harry groped for the doorknob -- between filch and death, he'd take filch. 

they fell backward -- harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn't see him anywhere, but they hardly cared -- all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster. they didn't stop running until they reached the portrait of the fat lady on the seventh floor. 

"where on earth have you all been?" she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces. 

"never mind that -- pig snout, pig snout," panted harry, and the portrait swung forward. they scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs. 

it was a while before any of them said anything. neville, indeed, looked as if he'd never speak again. 

"what do they think they're doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?" said ron finally. "if any dog needs exercise, that one does." 

hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. "you don't use your eyes, any of you, do you?" she snapped. "didn't you see what it was standing on. 

"the floor?" harry suggested. "i wasn't looking at its feet, i was too busy with its heads." 

"no, not the floor. it was standing on a trapdoor. it's obviously guarding something." 

she stood up, glaring at them. 

i hope you're pleased with yourselves. we could all have been killed -- or worse, expelled. now, if you don't mind, i'm going to bed." 

ron stared after her, his mouth open. 

"no, we don't mind," he said. "you'd think we dragged her along, wouldn't you. 

but hermione had given harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed. the dog was guarding something.... what had hagrid said? gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide -- except perhaps hogwarts. 

it looked as though harry had found out where the grubby littie package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was. 

chapter ten 

halloween 

malfoy couldn't believe his eyes when he saw that harry and ron were still at hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. 

indeed, by the next morning harry and ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. in the meantime, harry filled ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from gringotts to hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection. "it's either really valuable or really dangerous," said ron. 

"or both," said harry. 

but as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn't have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues. 

neither neville nor hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. all neville cared about was never going near the dog again. 

hermione was now refusing to speak to harry and ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. all they really wanted now was a way of getting back at malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later. 

as the owls flooded into the great hall as usual, everyone's attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls. harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. they had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel. 

harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said: do not open the parcel at the table. 

it contains your new nimbus two thousand, but i don't want everybody knowing you've got a broomstick or they'll all want one. oliver wood will meet you tonight on the quidditch field at seven o'clock for your first training session. 

professor mcgonagall harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to ron to read. 

"a nimbus two thousand!" ron moaned enviously. "i've never even touched one." 

they left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by crabbe and goyle. malfoy seized the package from harry and felt it. 

"that's a broomstick," he said, throwing it back to harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face. "you'll be in for it this time, potter, first years aren't allowed them." 

ron couldn't resist it. 

"it's not any old broomstick," he said, "it's a nimbus two thousand. 

what did you say you've got at home, malfoy, a comet two sixty?" ron grinned at harry. "comets look flashy, but they're not in the same league as the nimbus." 

"what would you know about it, weasley, you couldn't afford half the handle," malfoy snapped back. "i suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig." 

before ron could answer, professor flitwick appeared at malfoy's elbow. 

"not arguing, i hope, boys?" he squeaked. 

"potter's been sent a broomstick, professor," said malfoy quickly. 

"yes, yes, that's right," said professor flitwick, beaming at harry. 

"professor mcgonagall told me all about the special circumstances, potter. and what model is it?" 

"a nimbus two thousand, sit," said harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on malfoy's face. "and it's really thanks to malfoy here that i've got it," he added. 

harry and ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at malfoy's obvious rage and confusion. "well, it's true," harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, "if he hadn't stolen neville's remembrall i wouln't be on the team...." 

"so i suppose you think that's a reward for breaking rules?" came an angry voice from just behind them. hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in harry's hand. 

"i thought you weren't speaking to us?" said harry. 

"yes, don't stop now," said ron, "it's doing us so much good." 

hermione marched away with her nose in the air. 

harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. it kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the quidditch field where he'd be learning to play that night. he bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with ron to unwrap the nimbus two thousand at last. 

"wow," ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto harry's bedspread. 

even harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful. sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and nimbus two thousand written in gold near the top. 

as seven o'clock drew nearer, harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the quidditch field. held never been inside the stadium before. hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. at either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. they reminded harry of the little plastic sticks muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high. 

too eager to fly again to wait for wood, harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground. what a feeling -- he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. the nimbus two thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch. 

"hey, potter, come down!' oliver wood had arrived. fie was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm. harry landed next to him. 

"very nice," said wood, his eyes glinting. "i see what mcgonagall meant... you really are a natural. i'm just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you'll be joining team practice three times a week." 

he opened the crate. inside were four different-sized balls. 

"right," said wood. "now, quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it's not too easy to play. there are seven players on each side. 

three of them are called chasers." 

"three chasers," harry repeated, as wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball. 

"this ball's called the quaffle," said wood. "the chasers throw the quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal. ten points every time the quaffle goes through one of the hoops. follow me?" 

"the chasers throw the quaffle and put it through the hoops to score," 

harry recited. "so -- that's sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn't it?" 

"what's basketball?" said wood curiously. "never mind," said harry quickly. 

"now, there's another player on each side who's called the keeper -i'm keeper for gryffindor. i have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring." 

"three chasers, one keeper," said harry, who was determined to remember it all. "and they play with the quaffle. okay, got that. so what are they for?" he pointed at the three balls left inside the box. 

"i'll show you now," said wood. "take this." 

he handed harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat. 

"i'm going to show you what the bludgers do," wood said. "these two are the bludgers." 

he showed harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the red quaffle. harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box. 

"stand back," wood warned harry. he bent down and freed one of the bludgers. 

ad, harry was finding it exceptionally difficult to focus on the
correct method for strengthening solution. hermione was not helping matters; the cheers and the
sound of vomit hitting the bottom of fred and george's bucket were punctuated by her loud and
disapproving sniffs, which harry found, if anything, more distracting.
"just go and stop them, then!" he said irritably, after crossing out the wrong weight of powdered
griffin claw for the fourth time.
"i can't, they're not technically doing anything wrong," said hermione through gritted teeth.
"they're quite within their rights to eat the foul things themselves and i can't find a rule that says the other idiots aren't entitled to buy them, not unless they're proven to be dangerous in some way and it doesn't look as though they are."
she, harry and ron watched george projectile-vomit into the bucket, gulp down the rest of the
chew and straighten up, beaming with his arms wide to protracted applause.
"you know, i don't get why fred and george only got three owls each," said harry, watching
as fred, george and lee collected gold from the eager crowd. "they really know their stuff."
"oh, they only know flashy stuff that's of no real use to anyone," said hermione disparagingly.
"no real use?" said ron in a strained voice. "hermione, they've made about twenty-six galleons
already."
it was a long while before the crowd around the weasley twins dispersed, then fred, lee and
george sat up counting their takings even longer, so it was well past midnight when harry, ron
and hermione finally had the common room to themselves. at long last, fred had closed the
doorway to the boys' dormitories behind him, rattling his box of galleons ostentatiously so that
hermione scowled. harry, who was making very little progress with his potions essay, decided
to give it up for the night. as he put his books away, ron, who was dozing lightly in an
armchair, gave a muffled grunt, awoke, and looked blearily into the fire.
"sirius!" he said.
harry whipped round. siriuss untidy dark head was sitting in the fire again.
"hi," he said, grinning.
"hi," chorused harry, ron and hermione, all three kneeling down on the hearthrug. crookshanks purred loudly and approached the fire, trying, despite the heat, to put his face close
to sirius's.
"how're things?" said sirius.
"not that good," said harry, as hermione pulled crookshanks back to stop him singeing his
whiskers. "the ministry's forced through another decree, which means we're not allowed to have quidditch teams -"
"or secret defense against the dark arts groups?" said sirius.
there was a short pause.
"how did you know about that?" harry demanded.
"you want to choose your meeting places more carefully," said sirius, grinning still more
broadly. "the hog's head, i ask you."
"well, it was better than the three broomsticks!" said hermione defensively. "that's always
packed with people -"
"which means you'd have been harder to overhear," said sirius. "you've got a lot to learn,
hermione."
"who overheard us?" harry demanded.
"mundungus, of course," said sirius, and when they all looked puzzled he laughed. "he was the
witch under the veil."
"that was mundungus?" harry said, stunned. "what was he doing in the hog's head?"
"what do you think he was doing?" said sirius impatiently. "keeping an eye on you, of course."
"i'm still being followed?" asked harry angrily.
"yeah, you are," said sirius, "and just as well, isn't it, if the first thing you're going to do on your weekend off is organize an illegal defense group."
but he looked neither angry nor worried. on the contrary, he was looking at harry with distinct
pride.
"why was dung hiding from us?" asked ron, sounding disappointed. "we'd've liked to've seen
him."
"he was banned from the hog's head twenty years ago," said sirius, "and that barman's got a
long memory. we lost moody's spare invisibility cloak when sturgis was arrested, so dung's
been dressing as a witch a lot lately... anyway... first of all, ron - i've sworn to pass on a
message from your mother."
"oh yeah?" said ron, sounding apprehensive.
"she says on no account whatsoever are you to take part in an illegal secret defense against the
dark arts group. she says you'll be expelled for sure and your future will be ruined. she says
there will be plenty of time to learn how to defend yourself later and that you are too young to be
worrying about that right now. she also" (sirius's eyes turned to the other two) "advises harry
and hermione not to proceed with the group, though she accepts that she has no authority over
either of them and simply begs them to remember that she has their best interests at heart. she
would have written all this to you, but if the owl had been intercepted you'd all have been in real
trouble, and she can't say it for herself because she's on duty tonight."
"on duty doing what?" said ron quickly.
"never you mind, just stuff for the order," said sirius. "so it's fallen to me to be the messenger
and make sure you tell her i passed it all on, because i don't think she trusts me to."
there was another pause in which crookshanks, mewing, attempted to paw sirius's head, and
ron fiddled with a hole in the hearthrug.
"so, you want me to say i'm not going to take part in the defense group?" he muttered finally.
"me? certainly not!" said sirius, looking surprised. "i think it's an excellent idea!"
"you do?" said harry, his heart lifting.
"of course i do!" said sirius. "d'you think your father and i would've lain down and taken orders from an old hag like umbridge?"
"but - last term all you did was tell me to be careful and not take risks -"
"last year, all the evidence was that someone inside hogwarts was trying to kill you, harry!"
said sirius impatiently. "this year, we know there's someone outside hogwarts who'd like to kill us all, so i think learning to defend yourselves properly is a very good idea!"
"and if we do get expelled?" hermione asked, a quizzical look on her face.
"hermione, this whole thing was your idea!" said harry, staring at her.
"i know it was. i just wondered what sirius thought," she said, shrugging.
"well, better expelled and able to defend yourselves than sitting safely in school without a clue,"
said sirius.
"hear, hear," said harry and ron enthusiastically.
"so," said sirius, "how are you organizing this group? where are you meeting?"
"well, that's a bit of a problem now," said harry. "dunno where we're going to be able to go."
"how about the shrieking shack?" suggested sirius.
"hey, that's an idea!" said ron excitedly, but hermione made a skeptical noise and all three of
them looked at her, sirius's head turning in the flames.
"well, sirius, it's just that there were only four of you meeting in the shrieking shack when you
were at school," said hermione, "and all of you could transform into animals and i suppose you
could all have squeezed under a single invisibility cloak if you'd wanted to. but there are
twenty-eight of us and none of us is an animagus, so we wouldn't need so much an invisibility
cloak as an invisibility marquee -"
"fair point," said sirius, looking slightly crestfallen. "well, i'm sure you'll come up with
somewhere. there used to be a pretty roomy secret passageway behind that big mirror on the
fourth floor, you might have enough space to practice jinxes in there."
"fred and george told me it's blocked," said harry, shaking his head. "caved in or something."
"oh..." said sirius, frowning. "well, i'll have a think and get back to -"
he broke off. his face was suddenly tense, alarmed. he turned sideways, apparently looking into
the solid brick wall of the fireplace.
"sirius?" said harry anxiously.
but he had vanished. harry gaped at the flames for a moment, then turned to look at ron and
hermione.
"why did he -?"
hermione gave a horrified gasp and leapt to her feet, still staring at the fire.
a hand had appeared amongst the flames, groping as though to catch hold of something; a
stubby, short-fingered hand covered in ugly old-fashioned rings.
the three of them ran for it. at the door of the boys' dormitory harry looked back. umbridge's
hand was still making snatching movements amongst the flames, as though she knew exactly
where sirius's hair had been moments before and was determined to seize it.
chapter eighteen
dumbledore's army
"umbridge has been reading your mail, harry. there's no other explanation."
"you think umbridge attacked hedwig?" he said, outraged.
"i'm almost certain of it," said hermione grimly. "watch your frog, it's escaping."
harry pointed his wand at the bullfrog that had been hopping hopefully towards the other side of
the table - "accio!" - and it zoomed gloomily back into his hand.
charms was always one of the best lessons in which to enjoy a private chat; there was generally
so much movement and activity that the danger of being overheard was very slight. today, with
the room full of croaking bullfrogs and cawing ravens, and with a heavy downpour of rain
clattering and pounding against the classroom windows, harry, ron and hermione's whispered
discussion about how umbridge had nearly caught sirius went quite unnoticed.
"i've been suspecting this ever since filch accused you of ordering dungbombs, because it
seemed such a stupid lie," hermione whispered. "i mean, once your letter had been read it would
have been quite clear you weren't ordering them, so you wouldn't have been in trouble at all - it's a bit of a feeble joke, isn't it? but then i thought, what if somebody just wanted an excuse to read your mail? well then, it would be a perfect way for umbridge to manage it - tip off filch, let him do the dirty work and confiscate the letter, then either find a way of stealing it from him or else demand to see it - i don't think filch would object, when's he ever stuck up for a student's rights? harry, you're squashing your frog."
harry looked down; he was indeed squeezing his bullfrog so tightly its eyes were popping; he
replaced it hastily upon the desk.
n and hermione playing chess. chess was the only thing hermione ever lost at, something harry and ron thought was very good for her. 

"don't talk to me for a moment," said ron when harry sat down next to him, "i need to concen --" he caught sight of harry's face. "what's the matter with you? you look terrible." 

speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, harry told the other two about snape's sudden, sinister desire to be a quidditch referee. 

"don't play," said hermione at once. 

"say you're ill," said ron. 

"pretend to break your leg," hermione suggested. 

"really break your leg," said ron. 

"i can't," said harry. "there isn't a reserve seeker. if i back out, gryffindor can't play at all." 

at that moment neville toppled into the common room. how he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone's guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the leg-locker curse. he must have had to bunny hop all the way up to gryffindor tower. 

everyone fell over laughing except hermione, who leapt up and performed the countercurse. neville's legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling. "what happened?" hermione asked him, leading him over to sit with harry and ron. 

"malfoy," said neville shakily. "i met him outside the library. he said he'd been looking for someone to practice that on." 

"go to professor mcgonagall!" hermione urged neville. "report him!" 

neville shook his head. 

"i don't want more trouble," he mumbled. 

"you've got to stand up to him, neville!" said ron. "he's used to walking all over people, but that's no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier." 

"there's no need to tell me i'm not brave enough to be in gryffindor, malfoy's already done that," neville choked out. 

harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a chocolate frog, the very last one from the box hermione had given him for christmas. he gave it to neville, who looked as though he might cry. 

"you're worth twelve of malfoy," harry said. "the sorting hat chose you for gryffindor, didn't it? and where's malfoy? in stinking slytherin." 

neville's lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog. 

"thanks, harry... i think i'll go to bed.... d'you want the card, you collect them, don't you?" 

as neville walked away, harry looked at the famous wizard card. 

"dumbledore again," he said, "he was the first one i ever-" 

he gasped. he stared at the back of the card. then he looked up at ron and hermione. 

"i've found him!" he whispered. "i've found flamel! i told you i'd read the name somewhere before, i read it on the train coming here -- listen to this: 'dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, nicolas flamel'!" 

hermione jumped to her feet. she hadn't looked so excited since they'd gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework. 

"stay there!" she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls' dormitories. harry and ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms. 

"i never thought to look in here!" she whispered excitedly. "i got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading." 

"light?" said ron, but hermione told him to be quiet until she'd looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to herself. 

at last she found what she was looking for. 

"i knew it! i knew it!" 

"are we allowed to speak yet?" said ron grumpily. hermione ignored him. 

"nicolas flamel," she whispered dramatically, "is the only known maker of the sorcerer's stone!" 

this didn't have quite the effect she'd expected. 

"the what?" said harry and ron. 

"oh, honestly, don't you two read? look -- read that, there." 

she pushed the book toward them, and harry and ron read: the ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the sorcerer's stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers. the stone will transform any metal into pure gold. it also produces the elixir of life, which will make the drinker immortal. 

there have been many reports of the sorcerer's stone over the centuries, but the only stone currently in existence belongs to mr. nicolas flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. mr. flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in devon with his wife, perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight). 

"see?" said hermione, when harry and ron had finished. "the dog must be guarding flamel's sorcerer's stone! i bet he asked dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they're friends and he knew someone was after it, that's why he wanted the stone moved out of gringotts!" 

"a stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!" said harry. "no wonder snape's after it! anyone would want it." 

"and no wonder we couldn't find flamel in that study of recent developments in wizardry," said ron. "he's not exactly recent if he's six hundred and sixty-five, is he?" 

the next morning in defense against the dark arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, harry and ron were still discussing what they'd do with a sorcerer's stone if they had one. it wasn't until ron said he'd buy his own quidditch team that harry remembered about snape and the coming match. 

"i'm going to play," he told ron and hermione. "if i don't, all the slytherins will think i'm just too scared to face snape. i'll show them... it'll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win." 

"just as long as we're not wiping you off the field," said hermione. 

as the match drew nearer, however, harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told ron and hermione. the rest of the team wasn't too calm, either. the idea of overtaking slytherin in the house championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee? harry didn't know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into snape wherever he went. at times, he even wondered whether snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, snape was so horrible to harry. could snape possibly know they'd found out about the sorcerer's stone? harry didn't see how he could -- yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that snape could read minds. 

harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that ron and hermione were wondering whether they'd ever see him alive again. this wasn't what you'd call comforting. harry hardly heard a word of wood's pep talk as he pulled on his quidditch robes and picked up his nimbus two thousand. 

ron and hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to neville, who couldn't understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match. little did harry know that ron and hermione had been secretly practicing the leg-locker curse. they'd gotten the idea from malfoy using it on neville, and were ready to use it on snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt harry. 

"now, don't forget, it's locomotor mortis," hermione muttered as ron slipped his wand up his sleeve. 

"i know," ron snapped. "don't nag." 

back in the locker room, wood had taken harry aside. 

"don't want to pressure you, potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the snitch it's now. finish the game before snape can favor hufflepuff too much." 

"the whole school's out there!" said fred weasley, peering out of the door. "even -- blimey -- dumbledore's come to watch!" 

harry's heart did a somersault. 

"dumbledore?" he said, dashing to the door to make sure. fred was right. 

there was no mistaking that silver beard. 

harry could have laughed out loud with relief he was safe. there was simply no way that snape would dare to try to hurt him if dumbledore was watching. 

perhaps that was why snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that ron noticed, too. 

"i've never seen snape look so mean," he told hermione. "look -they're off ouch!" 

someone had poked ron in the back of the head. it was malfoy. 

"oh, sorry, weasley, didn't see you there." 

malfoy grinned broadly at crabbe and goyle. 

"wonder how long potter's going to stay on his broom this time? anyone want a bet? what about you, weasley?" 

ron didn't answer; snape had just awarded hufflepuff a penalty because george weasley had hit a bludger at him. hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the snitch. 

"you know how i think they choose people for the gryffindor team?" said malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as snape awarded hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all. "it's people they feel sorry for. see, there's potter, who's got no parents, then there's the weasleys, who've got no money -- you should be on the team, longbottom, you've got no brains." 

neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face malfoy. 

"i'm worth twelve of you, malfoy," he stammered. 

malfoy, crabbe, and goyle howled with laughter, but ron, still not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, "you tell him, neville." 

"longbottom, if brains were gold you'd be poorer than weasley, and that's saying something." 

ron's nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about harry. 

"i'm warning you, malfoy -- one more word "ron!" said hermione suddenly, "harry --" 

"what? where?" 

harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet. 

"you're in luck, weasley, potter's obviously spotted some money on the ground!" said malfoy.by casting a protective charm over any muggle dwellings in your street. many lives could be saved if such simple measures are taken."
"and what would you say, royal, to those listeners who reply that in these dangerous times, it should be 'wizards first'? asked lee.
"i'd say that it's one short step from 'wizards first' to 'purebloods first,' and then to 'death eaters,'" replied kingsley. "we're all human, aren't we? every human life is worth the same, and worth saving."
"excellently put, royal, and you've got my vote for minister of magic if we ever get out of this mess," said lee. "and now, over to romulus for our popular feature 'pals of potter.'"
"thanks, river," said another very familiar voice. ron started to speak, but hermione forestalled him in a whisper.
"we know it's lupin!"
"romulus, do you maintain, as you have every time you've appeared on our program, that harry potter is still alive?"
"i do," said lupin firmly. "there is no doubt at all in my mind that his death would be proclaimed as widely as possible by the death eaters if it had happened, because it would strike a deadly blow at the morale of those resisting the new regime. 'the boy who lived' remains a symbol of everything for which we are fighting: the triumph of good, the power of innocence, the need to keep resisting."
a mixture of gratitude and shame welled up in harry. had lupin forgiven him, then, for the terrible things he had said when they had last met?
"and what would you say to harry if you knew he was listening, romulus?"
"i'd tell him we're all with him in spirit," said lupin, then hesitated slightly, "and i'd tell him to follow his instincts, which are good and nearly always right."
harry looked at hermione, whose eyes were full of tears.
"nearly always right," she repeated.
"oh, didn't i tell you?" said ron in surprise. "bill told me lupin's living with tonks again! and apparently she's getting pretty big too..."
"...and our usual update on those friends of harry potter's who are suffering for their allegiance?" lee was saying.
"well, as regular listeners will know, several of the more outspoken supporters of harry potter have now been imprisoned, including xenophilius lovegood, erstwhile editor of the quibbler," said lupin.
"at least he's still alive!" muttered ron.
"we have also heard within the last few hours that rubeus hagrid" - all three of them gasped, and so nearly missed the rest of the sentence -- "well-known gamekeeper at hogwarts school, has narrowly escaped arrest within the grounds of hogwarts, where he is rumored to have hosted a 'support harry potter' party in his house. however, hagrid was not taken into custody, and is, we believe, on the run."
"i suppose it helps, when escaping from death eaters, if you've got a sixteen-foot-high half brother?" asked lee.
"it would tend to give you an edge," agreed lupin gravely. "may i just add that while we here at potterwatch applaud hagrid's spirit, we would urge even the most devoted of harry's supporters against following hagrid's lead. 'support harry potter' parties are unwise in the present climate."
"indeed they are, romulus," said lee, "so we suggest that you continue to show your devotion to the man with the lightning scar by listening to potterwatch! and now let's move to news concerning the wizard who is proving just as elusive as harry potter. we like to refer to him as the chief death eater, and here to give his views on some of the more insane rumors circulating about him, i'd like to introduce a new correspondent. rodent?"
"'rodent'?" said yet another familiar voice, and harry, ron, and hermione cried out together:
"fred!"
"no - is it george?"
"it's fred, i think," said ron, leaning in closer, as whichever twin it was said,
"i'm not being 'rodent,' no way, i told you i wanted to be 'rapier'!"
"oh, all right then, 'rapier,' could you please give us your take on the various stories we've been hearing about the chief death eater?"
"yes, river, i can," said fred. "as our listeners will know, unless they've taken refuge at the bottom of a garden pond or somewhere similar, you-know-who's strategy of remaining in the shadows is creating a nice little climate of panic. mind you, if all the alleged sightings of him are genuine, we must have a good nineteen you-know-whos running around the place."
"which suits him, of course," said kingsley. "the air of mystery is creating more terror than actually showing himself."
"agreed," said fred. "so, people, let's try and calm down a bit. things are bad enough without inventing stuff as well. for instance, this new idea that you-know-who can kill people with a single glance from his eyes. that's a basilisk, listeners. one simple test: check whether the thing that's glaring at you has got legs. if it has, it's safe to look into its eyes, although if it really is you-know-who, that's still likely to be the last thing you ever do."
for the first time in weeks and weeks, harry was laughing: he could feel the weight of tension leaving him.
"and the rumors that he keeps being sighted abroad?" asked lee.
"well, who wouldn't want a nice little holiday after all the hard work he's been putting in?" asked fred. "point is, people, don't get lulled into a false sense of security, thinking he's out of the country. maybe he is, maybe he isn't, but the fact remains he can move faster than severus snape confronted with shampoo when he wants to, so don't
count on him being a long way away if you're planning to take any risks. i never thought i'd hear myself say it, but safety first!"
"thank you very much for those wise words, rapier," said lee. "listeners, that brings us to the end of another potterwatch. we don't know when it will be possible to broadcast again, but you can be sure we shall be back. keep twiddling those dials: the next password will be 'mad-eye.' keep each other safe: keep faith. good night."
the radio's dial twirled and the lights behind the tuning panel went out. harry, ron, and hermione were still beaming. hearing familiar, friendly voices was an extraordinary tonic; harry had become so used to their isolation he had nearly forgotten that other people were resisting voldemort. it was like waking from a long sleep.
"good, eh?" said ron happily.
"brilliant," said harry.
"it's so brave of them," sighed hermione admiringly. "if they were found ..."
"well, they keep on the move, don't they?" said ron. "like us."
"but did you hear what fred said?" asked harry excitedly; now the broadcast was over, his thoughts turned around toward his all consuming obsession. "he's abroad! he's still looking for the wand, i knew it!"
"harry-"
"come on, hermione, why are you so determined not to admit it? vol -"
"harry, no!"
"-demort's after the elder wand!"
"the name's taboo!" ron bellowed, leaping to his feet as a loud crack sounded outside the tent. "i told you, harry, i told you, we can't say it anymore - we've got to put the protection back around us - quickly - it's how they find -"
but ron stopped talking, and harry knew why. the sneakoscope on the table had lit up and begun to spin; they could hear voices coming nearer and nearer: rough, excited voices. ron pulled the deluminator out of his pocket and clicked it: their lamps went out.
"come out of there with your hands up!" came a rasping voice through the darkness. "we know you're in there! you've got half a dozen wands pointing at you and we don't care who we curse!"
chapter twenty-three
malfoy manor
harry looked around at the other two, now mere outlines in the darkness. he saw hermione point her wand, set toward the outside, but into his face; there was a bang, a burst of white light, and he buckled in agony, unable to see. he could feel his face swelling rapidly under his hands as heavy footfalls surrounded him.
"get up, vermin."
unknown hands dragged harry roughly off the ground, before he could stop them, someone had rummaged through his pockets and removed the blackthorn wand. harry clutched at his excruciatingly painful face, which felt unrecognizable beneath his fingers, tight, swollen, and puffy as though he had suffered some violent allergic reaction. his
eyes had been reduced to slits through which he could barely see; his glasses fell off as he was bundled out of the tent: all he could make out were the blurred shapes of four or five people wrestling ron and hermione outside too.
"get -- off - her!" ron shouted. there was the unmistakable sound of knuckles hitting flesh: ron grunted in pain and hermione screamed, "no! leave him alone, leave him alone!"
"your boyfriend's going to have worse than that done to him if he's on my list," said the horribly familiar, rasping voice. "delicious girl... what a treat . . . i do enjoy the softness of the skin. . . ."
harry's stomach turned over. he knew who this was, fenrit greyback, the werewolf who was permitted to wear death eater robes in return for his hired savagery.
"search the tent!" said another voice.
harry was thrown face down onto the ground. a thud told him that ron had been cast down beside him. they could hear footsteps and crashes; the men were pushing over chairs inside the tent as they searched.
"now, let's see who we've got," said greyback's gloating voice from overhead, and harry was rolled over onto his back. a beam of wand light fell onto his face and greyback laughed.
"i'll be needing butterbeer to wash this one down. what happened to you, ugly?"
harry did not answer immediately.
"i said," repeated greyback, and harry received a blow to the diaphragm that made him double over in pain. "what happened to you?"
"stung." harry muttered. "been stung."
"yeah, looks like it." said a second voice.
"what's your name?" snarled greyback.
"dudley." said harry.
"and your first name?"
"i -- vernon. vernon dudley."
"check the list, scabior." said greyback, and harry head him move sideways to look down at ron, instead. "and what about you, ginger?"
"stan shunpike." said ron.
"like 'ell you are." said the man called scabior. "wehe saw the next-door neighbor, who had paused to restart his lawn mower, look up nervously.
harry sat down hard on the bed. the broken bit of mirror danced away from him; he picked it up and turned it over in his fingers, thinking, thinking of dumbledore and the lies with which rita skeeter was defaming him ...
a flash of brightest blue. harry froze, his cut finger slipping on the jagged edge of the mirror again. he had imagined it, he must have done. he glanced over his shoulder, but the wall was a sickly peach color of aunt petunia's choosing: there was nothing blue there for the mirror to reflect. he peered into the mirror fragment again, and saw nothing but his own bright green eye looking back at him.
he had imagined it, there was no other explanation; imagined it, because he had been thinking of his dead headmaster. if anything was certain, it was that the bright blue eyes of albus dumbledore would never pierce him again.
chapter three
the dursleys departing
the sound of the front door slamming echoed up the stairs and a voice roared, "oh! you!"
sixteen years of being addressed thus left harry in no doubt when his uncle was calling, nevertheless, he did not immediately respond. he was still at the narrow fragment in which, for a split second, he had thought he saw dumbledore's eye. it was not until his uncle bellowed, "boy!" that harry got slowly out of bed and headed for the bedroom door, pausing to add the piece of broken mirror to the rucksack filled with things he would be taking with him.
"you took you time!" roared vernon dursley when harry appeared at the top of the stairs, "get down here. i want a word!"
harry strolled downstairs, his hands deep in his pants pockets. when he searched the living room he found all three dursleys. they were dressed for packing; uncle vernon in an old ripped-up jacket and dudley, harry's, large, blond, muscular cousin, in his leather jacket.
"yes?" asked harry.
"sit down!" said uncle vernon. harry raised his eyebrows. "please!" added uncle vernon, wincing slightly as though the word was sharp in his throat.
harry sat. he though he knew what was coming. his uncle began to pace up and down, aunt petunia and dudley, following his movement with anxious expressions. finally, his large purple face crumpled with concentration. uncle vernon stopped in front of harry and spoke.
"i've changed my mind," he said.
"what a surprise," said harry.
"don't you take that tone-" began aunt petunia in a shrill voice, but vernon dursley waved her down
"it's all a lot of claptrap," said uncle vernon, glaring at harry with piggy little eyes. "i've decided i don't believe a word of it. we're staying put, we're not going anywhere."
harry looked up at his uncle and felt a mixture of exasperation and amusement. vernon dursley had been changing his mind every twenty four hours for the past four weeks, packing and unpacking and repacking the car with every change of heart. harry's favorite moment had been the one when uncle vernon, unaware the dudley had added his dumbbells to his case since the last time it been repacked, had attempted to hoist it back into the boot and collapsed with a yelp of pain and much swearing.
"according to you," vernon dursley said, now resuming his pacing up and down the living room, "we - petunia, dudley, and i - are in danger. from - from -"
"some of 'my lot' right?" said harry
"well i don't believe it," repeated uncle vernon, coming to a halt in front of harry again. "i was awake half the night thinking it all over, and i believe it's a plot to get the house."
"the house?" repeated harry. "what house?"
"this house!" shrieked uncle vernon, the vein his forehead starting to pulse. "our house! house prices are skyrocketing around here! you want us out of the way and
then you're going to do a bit of hocus pocus and before we know it the deeds will be in your name and -"
"are you out of your mind?" demanded harry. "a plot to get this house? are you actually as stupid as you look?"
"don't you dare --!" squealed aunt petunia, but again vernon waved her down. slights on his personal appearance were it seemed as nothing to the danger he had spotted.
"just in case you've forgotten," said harry, "i've already got a house my godfather left me one. so why would i want this one? all the happy memories?"
there was silence. harry thought he had rather impressed his uncle with this argument.
"you claim," said uncle vernon, starting to pace yet again, "that this lord thing -"
"-voldemort," said harry impatiently, "and we've been through this about a hundred times already. this isn't a claim, it's fact. dumbledore told you last year, and kingsley and mr. weasley -"
vernon dursley hunched his shoulders angrily, and harry guessed that his uncle was attempting to ward off recollections of the unannounced visit, a few days into harry's summer holidays, of two fully grown wizards. the arrival on the doorstep of kingsley shacklebolt and arthur weasley had come as a most unpleasant shock to the dursleys. harry had to admit, however that as mr. weasley had once demolished half of the living room, his reappearance could not have been expected to delight uncle vernon.
"-kingsley and mr. weasley explained it all as well," harry pressed on remorselessly, "once i'm seventeen, the protective charm that keeps me safe will break, and that exposes you as well as me. the order is sure voldemort will target you, whether to torture you to try and find out where i am, or because he thinks by holding you hostage i'd come and try to rescue you."
uncle vernon's and harry's eyes met. harry was sure that in that instant they were both wondering the same thing. then uncle vernon walked on and harry resumed, "you've got to go into hiding and the order wants to help. you're being offered serious protection, the best there is."
uncle vernon said nothing but continued to pace up and down. outside the sun hung low over the privet hedges. the next door neighbor's lawn mower stalled again.
"i thought there was a ministry of magic?" asked vernon dursley abruptly.
"there is," said harry, surprised.
"well, then, why can't they protect us? it seems to me that, as innocent victims, guilty of nothing more than harboring a marked man, we ought to qualify for government protection!"
harry laughed; he could not help himself. it was so very typical of his uncle to put his hopes in the establishment, even within this world that he despised and mistrusted.
"you heard what mr. weasley and kingsley said," harry replied.
"we think the ministry has been infiltrated."
uncle vernon strode back to the fireplace and back breathing so strongly that his great black mustache rippled his face still purple with concentration.
"all right," he said. stopping in front of harry get again. "all right, let's say for the sake of argument we accept this protection. i still don't see why we can't have that kingsley bloke."
harry managed not to roll his eyes, but with difficulty. this question had also been addressed half a dozen times.
"as i've told you," he said through gritted teeth, "kingsley is protecting the mug - i mean, your prime minister."
"exactly - he's the best!" said uncle vernon, pointing at the blank television screen. the dursleys had spotted kingsley on the news, walking along the muggle prime minister as he visited a hospital. this, and the fact that kingsley had mastered the knack of dressing like a muggle, not to mention a certain reassuring something in his slow, deep voice, had caused the dursleys to take to kingsley in a way that they had certainly not done with any other wizard, although it was true that they had never seen him with earring in.
"well, he's taken," said harry. "but hestia jones and dedalus diggle are more than up to the job -"
"if we'd even seen cvs..." began uncle vernon, but harry lost patience. getting to his feet, he advanced on his uncle, not pointing at the tv set himself.
"these accidents aren't accidents - the crashed and explosions and derailments and whatever else has happened since we last watched the news. people are disappearing and dying and he's behind it - voldemort. i've told you this over and over again, he kills muggles for fun. even the fogs - they're caused by dementors, and if you can't remember what they are, ask your son!"
dudley's hands jerked upward to tower his mouth. with his parents' and harry's eyes upon him, he slowly lowered them again and asked, "there are... more of them?"
"more?" laughed harry. "more than the two that attacked us, you mean? of course there are hundreds, maybe thousands by this time, seeing as they feed off fear and despair-"
"all right, all right blustered," blustered vernon dursley. "you've made your point -"
"i hope so," said harry, "because once i'm seventeen, all of them - death eaters, elementors, maybe even inferi - which means dead bodies enchanted by a dark wizard - will be able to find you and will certainly attack you. and if you remember the last time you tried to outrun wizards, i think you'll agree you need help."
there was a brief silence in which the distant echo of hagrid smashing down a wooden front door seemed to reverberate through the intervening years. aunt petunia was looking at uncle vernon; dudley was staring at harry. finally uncle vernon blurted out, "but what about my work? what about dudley's school? i don't suppose those things matter to a bunch of layabout wizards -"
"don't you understand?" shouted harry. "they will torture and kill you like they did my parents!"
"dad," said dudley in a loud voice, "dad - i'm going with these order people."
"dudley," said harry, "for the first time in your life, you're talking sense."
he knew the battle was won. if dudley was frightened enough to accept the order's help, his parents would accompany him. there could be no question of being separated from their duddykins. harry glanced at the carriage clock on the mantelpiece.
"they'll be here in about five minutes, he said, and when one of the dursu know," she said in a quiet voice. "a couple of weeks ago. roger. i turned
him down, though."
harry, who had grabbed the sugar bowl to excuse his sudden lunging movement across the table,
could not think why she was telling him this. if she wished she were sitting at the next table
being heartily kissed by roger davies, why had she agreed to come out with him?
he said nothing. their cherub threw another handful of confetti over them; some of it landed in
the last cold dregs of coffee harry had been about to drink.
"i came in here with cedric last year," said cho.
in the second or so it took for him to take in what she had said, harry's insides had become
glacial. he could not believe she wanted to talk about cedric now, while kissing couples
surrounded them and a cherub floated over their heads.
cho's voice was rather higher when she spoke again.
"i've been meaning to ask you for ages... did cedric - did he - m - m - mention me at all before
he died?"
this was the very last subject on earth harry wanted to discuss, and least of all with cho.
"well - no -" he said quietly. "there - there wasn't time for him to say anything. erm... so...
d'you... d'you get to see a lot of quidditch in the holidays? you support the tornados, right?"
his voice sounded falsely bright and cheery. to his horror, he saw that her eyes were swimming
with tears again, just as they had been after the last d.a. meeting before christmas.
"look," he said desperately, leaning in so that nob ody else could overhear, "let's not talk about
cedric right now... let's talk about something else."
but this, apparently, was quite the wrong thing to say.
"i thought," she said, tears spattering down on to the table, "i thought you'd u - u - understand!
i need to talk about it! surely you n - need to talk about it t - too! i mean, you saw it happen, d -
didn't you?"
everything was going nightmarishly wrong; roger davies's girlfriend had even unglued herself
to look round at cho crying.
"well - i have talked about it," harry said in a whisper, "to ron and hermione, but -"
"oh, you'll talk to hermione granger!" she said shrilly, her face now shining with tears. several
more kissing couples broke apart to stare. "but you won't talk to me! p - perhaps it would be best if we just... just p - paid and you went and met up with hermione g - granger, like you
obviously want to!"
harry stared at her, utterly bewildered, as she seized a frilly napkin and dabbed at her shining
face with it.
"cho?" he said weakly, wishing roger would seize his girlfriend and start kissing her again to
stop her goggling at him and cho.
"go on, leave!" she said, now crying into the napkin. "i don't know why you asked me out in the
first place if you're going to make arrangements to meet other girls right after me... how many
are you meeting after hermione?"
"it's not like that!" said harry, and he was so relieved at finally understanding what she was
annoyed about that he laughed, which he realized a split second too late was also a mistake.
cho sprang to her feet. the whole tearoom was quiet and everybody was watching them now.
"i'll see you around, harry" she said dramatically, and hiccoughing slightly she dashed to the
door, wrenched it open and hurried off into the pouring rain.
"cho!" harry called after her, but the door had already swung shut behind her with a tuneful
tinkle.
there was total silence within the teashop. every eye was on harry. he threw a galleon down on
to the table, shook pink confetti out of his hair, and followed cho out of the door.
it was raining hard now and she was nowhere to be seen. he simply did not understand what had
happened; half an hour ago they had been getting along fine.
"women!" he muttered angrily, sloshing down the rain-washed street with his hands in his
pockets. "what did she want to talk about cedric for, anyway? why does she always want to
drag up a subject that makes her act like a human hosepipe?"
he turned right and broke into a splashy run, and within minutes he was turning into the doorway
of the three broomsticks. he knew he was too early to meet hermione, but he thought it likely
there would be someone in here with whom he could spend the intervening time. he shook his
wet hair out of his eyes and looked around. hagrid was sitting alone in a corner, looking morose.
"hi, hagrid!" he said, when he had squeezed through the crammed tables and pulled up a chair
beside him.
hagrid jumped and looked down at harry as though he barely recognized him. harry saw that he
had two fresh cuts on his face and several new bruises.
"oh, it's yeh, harry," said hagrid. "yeh all right?"
"yeah, i'm fine," lied harry; but, next to this battered and mournful-looking hagrid, he felt he
didn't really have much to complain about. "er - are you okay?"
"me?" said hagrid. "oh yeah, i'm grand, harry, grand."
he gazed into the depths of his pewter tankard, which was the size of a large bucket, and sighed.
harry didn't know what to say to him. they sat side by side in silence for a moment. then
hagrid said abruptly, "in the same boat, yeh an' me, aren' we, 'arry?"
"er -" said harry.
"yeah... i've said it before... both outsiders, like," said hagrid, nodding wisely. "an' both
orphans. yeah... both orphans."
he took a great swig from his tankard.
"makes a diff'rence, havin' a decent family," he said. "me dad was decent. an' your mum an'
dad were decent. if they'd lived, life woulda bin diff'rent, eh?"
"yeah... i s'pose," said harry cautiously. hagrid seemed to be in a very strange mood.
"family," said hagrid gloomily. "whatever yeh say, blood's important..."
and he wiped a trickle of it out of his eye.
"hagrid," said harry, unable to stop himself, "where are you getting all these injuries?"
"eh?" said hagrid, looking startled. "wha' injuries?"
"all those!" said harry, pointing at hagrid's face.
"oh... tha's jus' normal bumps an' bruises, harry," said hagrid dismissively, "i got a rough job."
he drained his tankard, set it back on the table and got to his feet.
"i'll be seein' yeh, harry... take care now."
and he lumbered out of the pub looking wretched, and disappeared into the torrential rain. harry
watched him go, feeling miserable. hagrid was unhappy and he was hiding something, but he
seemed determined not to accept help. what was going on? but before harry could think about it
any further, he heard a voice calling his name.
"harry! harry, over here!"
hermione was waving at him from the other side of the room. he got up and made his way
towards her through the crowded pub. he was still a few tables away when he realized that
hermione was not alone. she was sitting at a table with the unlikeliest pair of drinking mates he
could ever have imagined: luna lovegood and none other than rita skeeter, ex-journalist on
the daily prophet and one of hermione's least favorite people in the world.
"you're early!" said hermione, moving along to give him room to sit down. "i thought you were
with cho, i wasn't expecting you for another hour at least!"
"cho?" said rita at once, twisting round in her seat to stare avidly at harry. "a girl?"
she snatched up her crocodile-skin handbag and groped within it.
"it's none of your business if harry's been with a h undred girls," hermione told rita coolly. "so you can put that away right now."
rita had been on the point of withdrawing an acid-green quill from her bag. looking as though
she had been forced to swallow stinksap, she snapped her bag shut again.
"what are you up to?" harry asked, sitting down and staring from rita to luna to hermione.
"little miss perfect was just about to tell me when you arrived," said rita, taking a large slurp of
her drink. "i suppose i'm allowed to talk to him, am i?" she shot at hermione.
"yes, i suppose you are," said hermione coldly.
unemployment did not suit rita. the hair that had once been set in elaborate curls now hung
lank and unkempt around her face. the scarlet paint on her two-inch talons was chipped and
there were a couple of false jewels missing from her winged glasses. she took another great gulp
of her drink and said out of the corner of her mouth, "pretty girl, is she, harry?"
"one more word about harry's love life and the deal's off and that's a promise," said hermione
irritably.
"what deal?" said rita, wiping her mouth on the back of her hand. "you haven't mentioned a
deal yet, miss prissy, you just told me to turn up. oh, one of these days..." she took a deep
shuddering breath.
"yes, yes, one of these days you'll write more horrible stories about harry and me," said
hermione indifferently. "find someone who cares, why don't you?"
"they've run plenty of horrible stories about harry this year without my help," said rita,
shooting a sideways look at him over the top of her glass and adding in a rough whisper, "how
has that made you feel, harry? betrayed? distraught? misunderstood?"
"he feels angry, of course," said hermione in a hard, clear voice. "because he's told the minister
for magic the truth and the minister's too much of an idiot to believe him."
"so you actually stick to it, do you, that he-who-must-not-be-named is back?" said rita,
lowering her glass and subjecting harry to a piercing stare while her finger strayed longingly to
the clasp of the crocodile bag. "you stand by all this garbage dumbledore's been telling
everybody about you-know-who returning and you being the sole witness?"
"i wasn't the sole witness," snarled harry. "there were a dozen-odd death eaters there as well.
want their names?"
"i'd love them," breathed rita, now fumbling in her bag once more and gazing at him as though
he was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen. "a great bold headline: 'potteraccuses... ' a
sub-heading, 'harry potter names death eaters still among us'. and then, beneath a nice big
photograph of you, 'disturbed teenage survivor of you-know-who'sattack, harry potter, 15,
caused outrage yesterday by accusing respectable and prominent members of the wizarding
community of being death eecent. he turned away and caught ron's eye instead, exchanging in silence a look that confirmed what ginny had said.
"how did he die?" whispered tonks. "how did it happen?"
"snape killed him," said harry. "i was there, i saw it. we arrived back on the astronomy tower because that's where the mark was. . . . dumbledore was ill, he was weak, but i think he realized it was a trap when we heard footsteps running up the stairs. he immobilized me, i couldn't do anything, i was under the invisibility cloak - and then malfoy came through the door and disarmed him -"
hermione clapped her hands to her mouth and ron groaned. luna's mouth trembled.
"- more death eaters arrived - and then snape - and snape did it. the avada kedavra." harry couldn't go on.
madam pomfrey burst into tears. nobody paid her any attention except ginny, who whispered, "shh! listen!"
gulping, madam pomfrey pressed her fingers to her mouth, her eyes wide. somewhere out in the darkness, a phoenix was singing in a way harry had never heard before: a stricken lament of terrible beauty. and harry felt, as he had felt about phoenix song before, that the music was inside him, not without: it was his own grief turned magically to song that echoed across the grounds and through the castle windows.
how long they all stood there, listening, he did not know, nor why it seemed to ease their pain a little to listen to the sound of their mourning, but it felt like a long time later that the hospital door opened again and professor mcgonagall entered the ward. like all the rest, she bore marks of the recent battle: there were grazes on her face and her robes were ripped.
"molly and arthur are on their way," she said, and the spell of the music was broken: everyone roused themselves as though coming out of trances, turning again to look at bill, or else to rub their own eyest shake their heads. "harry, what happened? according to hagrid you were with professor dumbledore when he - when it happened. he says professor snape was involved in some -" "snape killed dumbledore," said harry.
she stared at him for a moment, then swayed alarmingly; madam pomfrey, who seemed to have pulled herself together, ran forward, conjuring a chair from thin air, which she pushed under mcgonagall.
"snape," repeated mcgonagall faintly, falling into the chair. "we all wondered . . . but he trusted . . . always . . . snape... i can't believe it. ..."
"snape was a highly accomplished occlumens," said lupin, his voice uncharacteristically harsh. "we always knew that."
"but dumbledore swore he was on our side!" whispered tonks. "i always thought dumbledore must know something about snape that we didn't. ..." .
"he always hinted that he had an ironclad reason for trusting snape," muttered professor mcgonagall, now dabbing at the corners of her leaking eyes with a tartan-edged handkerchief. "i mean . . . with snapes history ... of course people were bound to wonder. . . but dumbledore told me explicitly that snape's repentance was absolutely genuine-----wouldn't hear a word against him!"
"i'd love to know what snape told him to convince him," said tonks.
"i know," said harry, and they all turned to look at him. "snape passed voldemort the information that made voldemort hunt down my mum and dad. then snape told dumbledore he hadn't realized what he was doing, he was really sorry he'd done it, sorry that they were dead."
they all stared at him.
"and dumbledore believed that?" said lupin incredulously. "dumbledore believed snape was sorry james was dead? snape hated james. . . ."
"and he didn't think my mother was worth a damn either," said harry, "because she was muggle-born... 'mudblood,' he called her. ..."
nobody asked how harry knew this. all of them seemed to be lost in horrified shock, trying to digest the monstrous truth of what had happened.
"this is all my fault," said professor mcgonagall suddenly. she looked disoriented, twisting her wet handkerchief in her hands. "my fault. i sent
filius to fetch snape tonight, i actually sent for him to come and help us! if i hadn't alerted snape to what was going on, he might never have joined forces with the death eaters. i don't think he knew they were there before filius told him, i don't think he knew they were coming."
"it isn't your fault, minerva," said lupin firmly. "we all wanted more help, we were glad to think snape was on his way...."
"so when he arrived at the fight, he joined in on the death eaters' side?" asked harry, who wanted every detail of snape's duplicity and infamy, feverishly collecting more reasons to hate him, to swear vengeance.
"i don't know exactly how it happened," said professor mcgonagall distractedly. "it's all so confusing. . . . dumbledore had told us that he would be leaving the school for a few hours and that we were to patrol the corridors just in case . . . remus, bill, and nymphadora were to join us ... and so we patrolled. all seemed quiet. every secret passageway out of the school was covered. we knew nobody could fly in. there were powerful enchantments on every entrance into the castle. i still don't know how the death eaters can possibly have entered. . . ."
"i do," said harry, and he explained, briefly, about the pair of vanishing cabinets and the magical pathway they formed. "so they got in through the room of requirement."
almost against his will he glanced from ron to hermione, both of whom looked devastated.
"i messed up, harry," said ron bleakly. "we did like you told us: we checked the marauder's map and we couldn't see malfoy on it, so we thought he must be in the room of requirement, so me, ginny, and neville went to keep watch on it... but malfoy got past us."
"he came out of the room about an hour after we started keeping watch," said ginny. "he was on his own, clutching that awful shriveled arm -"
"his hand of glory," said ron. "gives light only to the holder, remember?"
"anyway," ginny went on, "he must have been checking whether the coast was clear to let the death eaters out, because the moment he saw us he threw something into the air and it all went pitch-black -"
"- peruvian instant darkness powder," said ron bitterly. "fred and george's. i'm going to be having a word with them about who they let buy their products."
"we tried everything, lumos, incendio," said ginny. "nothing would penetrate the darkness; all we could do was grope our way out of the corridor again, and meanwhile we could hear people rushing past us. obviously malfoy could see because of that hand thing and was guiding them, but we didn't dare use any curses or anything in case we hit each other, and by the time we'd reached a corridor that was light, they'd gone."
"luckily," said lupin hoarsely, "ron, ginny, and neville ran into us almost immediately and told us what had happened. we found the death eaters minutes later, heading in the direction of the astronomy tower. malfoy obviously hadn't expected more people to be on the watch; he seemed to have exhausted his supply of darkness powder, at any rate. a fight broke out, they scattered and we gave chase. one of them, gibbon, broke away and headed up the tower stairs -"
"to set off the mark?" asked harry.
"he must have done, yes, they must have arranged that before they left the room of requirement," said lupin. "but i don't think gibbon liked the idea of waiting up there alone for dumbledore, because he came running back downstairs to rejoin the fight and was hit by a killing curse that just missed me."
"so if ron was watching the room of requirement with ginny and neville," said harry, turning to hermione, "were you - ?"
"outside snape's office, yes," whispered hermione, her eyes sparkling with tears, "with luna. we hung around for ages outside it and nothing happened. . . . we didn't know what was going on upstairs, ron had taken the map-----it was nearly midnight when professor flitwick came sprinting down into the dungeons. he was shouting about death eaters in the castle, i don't think he really registered that luna and i were there at all, he just burst his way into snape's office and we heard him saying that snape had to go back with him and help and then we heard a loud thump and snape came
hurtling out of his room and he saw us and - and -" "what?" harry urged her.
"i was so stupid, harry!" said hermione in a high-pitched whisper. "he said professor flitwick had collapsed and that we should go and take care of him while he - while he went to help fight the death eaters -" she covered her face in shame and continued to talk into her fingers, so that her voice was muffled. "we went into his office to see if we could help professor flitwick and found him unconscious on the floor. . . and oh, it's so obvious now, snape must have stupefied flitwick, but we didn't realize, harry, we didn't realize, we just let snape go!"
"it's not your fault," said lupin firmly. "hermione, had you not obeyed snape and got out of the way, he probably would have killed you and luna."
"so then he came upstairs," said harry, who was watching snape running up the marble staircase in his mind's eye, his black robes billowing behind him as ever, pulling his wand from under his cloak as he ascended, "and he found the place where you were all fighting. ..."
"we were in trouble, we were losing," said tonks in a low voice. "gibbon was down, but the rest of the death eaters seemed ready to fight to the death. neville had been hurt, bill had been savaged by greyback... it was all dark . . . curses flying everywhere . . . the malfoy boy had vanished, he must have slipped past, up the stairs . . . then more of them ran after him, but one of them blocked the stair behind them with some kind of curse. . . . neville ran at it and got thrown up into the air -"
"none of us could break through," said ron, "and that massive death eater was still firing off jinxes all over the place, they were bouncing off the walls and barely missing us. . . ."
"and then snape was there," said tonks, "and then he wasn points."

harry's stomach leapt - he was now tying for first place with cedric. ron and hermione, caught by surprise, stared at harry, then laughed and started applauding hard with the rest of the crowd.

"there you go. harry!" ron shouted over the noise. "you weren't being thick after all - you were showing moral fiber!"

fleur was clapping very hard too, but krum didn't look happy at all. he attempted to engage hermione in conversation again, but she was too busy cheering harry to listen.

"the third and final task will take place at dusk on the twenty-fourth of june,"

continued bagman. "the champions will be notified of what is coming precisely one month beforehand. thank you all for your support of the champions."

it was over. harry thought dazedly, as madam pomfrey began herding the champions and hostages back to the castle to get into dry clothes ... it was over, he had got through ... he didn't have to worry about anything now until june the twenty-fourth. . ..

next time he was in hogsmeade, harry decided as he walked back up the stone steps into the castle, he was going to buy dobby a pair of socks for every day of the year.



chapter twenty-seven - padfoot returns

one of the best things about the aftermath of the second task was that everybody was very keen to hear details of what had happened down in the lake, which meant that ron was getting to share harry's limelight for once. harry noticed that ron's version of events changed subtly with every retelling. at first, he gave what seemed to be the truth; it tallied with hermione's story, anyway - dumbledore had put all the hostages into a bewitched sleep in professor mcgonagall's office, first assuring them that they would be quite safe, and would awake when they were back above the water. one week later, however, ron was telling a thrilling tale of kidnap in which he struggled single-handedly against fifty heavily armed merpeople who had to beat him into submission before tying him up.

"but i had my wand hidden up my sleeve," he assured padma patil, who seemed to be a lot keener on ron now that he was getting so much attention and was making a point of talking to him every time they passed in the corridors. "i could've taken those mer-idiots any time i wanted."

"what were you going to do, snore at them?" said hermione waspishly. people had been teasing her so much about being the thing that viktor krum would most miss that she was in a rather tetchy mood.

ron's ears went red, and thereafter, he reverted to the bewitched sleep version of events.

as they entered march the weather became drier, but cruel winds skinned their hands and faces every time they went out onto the grounds. there were delays in the post because the owls kept being blown off course. the brown owl that harry had sent to sirius with the dates of the hogsmeade weekend turned up at breakfast on friday morning with half its feathers sticking up the wrong way; harry had no sooner torn off sirius's reply than it took flight, clearly afraid it was going to be sent outside again.

sirius's letter was almost as short as the previous one.

be at stile at end of road out of hogsmeade (past dervish and banges) at two o'clock on saturday afternoon. bring as much food as you can.

"he hasn't come back to hogsmeade?" said ron incredulously.

"it looks like it, doesn't it?" said hermione.

"i can't believe him," said harry tensely, "if he's caught. . ."

"made it so far, though, hasn't he?" said ron. "and it's not like the place is swarming with dementors anymore."

harry folded up the letter, thinking. if he was honest with himself, he really wanted to see sirius again. he therefore approached the final lesson of the afternoon - double potions - feeling considerably more cheerful than he usually did when descending the steps to the dungeons.

malfoy, crabbe, and goyle were standing in a huddle outside the classroom door with pansy parkinson's gang of slytherin girls. all of them were looking at something harry couldn't see and sniggering heartily. pansys pug-like face peered excitedly around goyle's broad back as harry, ron, and hermione approached.

"there they are, there they are!" she giggled, and the knot of slytherins broke apart. harry saw that pansy had a magazine in her hands - witch weekly. the moving picture on the front showed a curly-haired witch who was smiling toothily and pointing at a large sponge cake with her wand.

"you might find something to interest you in there, granger!" pansy said loudly, and she threw the magazine at hermione, who caught it, looking startled. at that moment, the dungeon door opened, and snape beckoned them all inside.

hermione, harry, and ron headed for a table at the back of the dungeon as usual.

once snape had turned his back on them to write up the ingredients of todays potion on the blackboard, hermione hastily rifled through the magazine under the desk. at last, in the center pages, hermione found what they were looking for.

harry and ron leaned in closer. a color photograph of harry headed a short piece entitled: harry potter's secret heartache a boy like no other, perhaps - yet a boy suffering all the usual pangs of adolescence, writes rita skeeter. deprived of love since the tragic demise of his parents, fourteen-year-old harry potter thought he had found solace in his steady girlfriend at hogwarts, muggle-born hermione granger. little did he know that he would shortly be suffering yet another emotional blow in a life already littered with personal loss.

miss granger, a plain but ambitious girl, seems to have a taste for famous wizards that harry alone cannot satisfy. since the arrival at hogwarts of viktor krum, bulgarian seeker and hero of the last world quidditch cup, miss granger has been toying with both boys' affections. krum, who is openly smitten with the devious miss granger, has already invited her to visit him in bulgaria over the summer holidays, and insists that he has "never felt this way about any other girl."

however, it might not be miss granger's doubtful natural charms that have captured these unfortunate boys' interest.

"she's really ugly," says pansy parkinson, a pretty and vivacious fourth-year student, "but she'd be well up to making a love potion, she's quite brainy. i think that's how she's doing it."

love potions are, of course, banned at hogwarts, and no doubt albus dumbledore will want to investigate these claims. in the meantime, harry potters well-wishers must hope that, next time, he bestows his heart on a worthier candidate.

"i told you!" ron hissed at hermione as she stared down at the article. "i told you not to annoy rita skeeter! she's made you out to be some sort of- of scarlet woman!"

hermione stopped looking astonished and snorted with laughter. "scarlet woman?" she repeated, shaking with suppressed giggles as she looked around at ron.

"it's what my mum calls them," ron muttered, his ears going red.

"if that's the best rita can do, she's losing her touch," said hermione, still giggling, as she threw witch weekly onto the empty chair beside her. "what a pile of old rubbish."

she looked over at the slytherins, who were all watching her and harry closely across the room to see if they had been upset by the article. hermione gave them a sarcastic smile and a wave, and she, harry, and ron started unpacking the ingredients they would need for their wit-sharpening potion.

"there's something funny, though," said hermione ten minutes later, holding her pestle suspended over a bowl of scarab beetles. "how could rita skeeter have known . . . ?"

"known what?" said ron quickly. "you haven't been mixing up love potions, have you?"

"don't be stupid," hermione snapped, starting to pound up her beetles again. "no, it's just. . . how did she know viktor asked me to visit him over the summer?"

hermione blushed scarlet as she said this and determinedly avoided ron's eyes.

"what?" said ron, dropping his pestle with a loud clunk.

"he asked me right after he'd pulled me out of the lake,"

hermione muttered. "after he'd got rid of his shark's head. madam pomfrey gave us both blankets and then he sort of pulled me away from the judges so they wouldn't hear, and he said, if i wasn't doing anything over the summer, would i like to -"

"and what did you say?" said ron, who had picked up his pestle and was grinding it on the desk, a good six inches from his bowl, because he was looking at

hermione.

"and he did say he'd never felt the same way about anyone else," hermione went on, going so red now that harry could almost feel the heat coming from her, "but how could rita skeeter have heard him? she wasn't there ... or was she? maybe she has got an invisibility cloak; maybe she sneaked onto the grounds to watch the second task. ..."

"and what did you say?" ron repeated, pounding his pestle down so hard that it dented the desk.

"well, i was too busy seeing whether you and harry were okay to-"

"fascinating though your social life undoubtedly is. miss granger," said an icy voice right behind them, and all three of them jumped, "i must ask you not to discuss it in my class. ten points from gryffindor."

snape had glided over to their desk while they were talking. the whole class was now looking around at them; malfoy took the opportunity to flash potter stinks across the dungeon at harry.

"ah . . . reading magazines under the table as well?" snape added, snatching up the copy of witch weekly. "a further ten points from gryffindor ... oh but of course ..." snapes black eyes glittered as they fell on rita skeeter's article. "potter has to keep up with his press cuttings. . . ."

the dungeon rang with the slytherins' laughter, and an unpleasant smile curled snape's thin mouth. to harry's fury, he began to read the article aloud.

"'harry potter's secret heartache. . . dear, dear. potter, what's ailing you now? 'a boy like no other, perhaps. . .'"

harry could feel his face burning. snape was pausing at the endurned back to snape. "oy!"
but too late; snape had directed his wand straight at james; there was a flash of light and a gash
appeared on the side of james's face, spattering his robes with blood. james whirled about: a
second flash of light later, snape was hanging upside-down in the air, his robes falling over his
head to reveal skinny, pallid legs and a pair of graying underpants.
many people in the small crowd cheered; sirius, james and wormtail roared with laughter.
lily, whose furious expression had twitched for an instant as though she was going to smile,
said, "let him down!"
"certainly," said james and he jerked his wand upwards; snape fell into a crumpled heap on the
ground. disentangling himself from his robes he got quickly to his feet, wand up, but sirius said, "locomotor mortis!" and snape keeled over again at once, rigid as a board.
"leave him alone!" lily shouted. she had her own wand out now. james and sirius eyed it warily.
"ah, evans, don't make me hex you," said james earnestly.
"take the curse off him, then!"
james sighed deeply, then turned to snape and muttered the counter-curse.
"there you go," he said, as snape struggled to his feet. "you're lucky evans was here, snivellus
--"
"i don't need help from filthy little mudbloods like her!"
lily blinked.
"fine," she said coolly. "i won't bother in future. and i'd wash your pants if i were you, snivellus."
"apologize to evans!" james roared at snape, his wand pointed threateningly at him.
"i don't want you to make him apologize," lily shouted, rounding on james. "you're as bad as he is."
"what?" yelped james. "i'd never call you a - you-know-what!"
"messing up your hair because you think it looks cool to look like you've just got off your
broomstick, showing off with that stupid snitch, walking down corridors and hexing anyone who
annoys you just because you can - i'm surprised your broomstick can get off the ground with that
fat head on it. you make me sick."
she turned on her heel and hurried away.
"evans!" james shouted after her. "hey, evans!"
but she didn't look back.
"what is it with her?" said james, trying and failing to look as though this was a throwaway
question of no real importance to him.
"reading between the lines, i'd say she thinks you're a bit conceited, mate," said sirius.
"right," said james, who looked furious now, "right -"
there was another flash of light, and snape was once again hanging upside-down in the air.
"who wants to see me take off snivelly's pants?"
but whether james really did take off snapes pants, harry never found out. a hand had closed
tight over his upper arm, closed with a pincer-like grip. wincing, harry looked round to see who
had hold of him, and saw, with a thrill of horror, a fully grown, adult-sized snape standing right
beside him, white with rage.
"having fun?"
harry felt himself rising into the air; the summer's day evaporated around him; he was floating
upwards through icy blackness, snape's hand still tight upon his upper arm. then, with a
swooping feeling as though he had turned head-over-heels in midair, his feet hit the stone floor
of snape's dungeon and he was standing again beside the pensieve on snape's desk in the
shadowy, present-day potion masters study.
"so," said snape, gripping harry's arm so tightly harry's hand was starting to feel numb. "so...
been enjoying yourself, potter?"
"n-no," said harry, trying to free his arm.
it was scary: snape's lips were shaking, his face was white, his teeth were bared.
"amusing man, your father, wasn't he?" said snape, shaking harry so hard his glasses slipped
down his nose.
"i - didn't -"
snape threw harry from him with all his might. harry fell hard on to the dungeon floor.
"you will not repeat what you saw to anybody!" snape bellowed.
"no," said harry, getting to his feet as far from snape as he could. "no, of course i w--"
"get out, get out, i don't want to see you in this office ever again!"
and as harry hurtled towards the door, a jar of dead cockroaches exploded over his head. he
wrenched the door open and flew along the corridor, stopping only when he had put three floors
between himself and snape. there he leaned against the wall, panting, and rubbing his bruised
arm.
he had no desire at all to return to gryffindor tower so early, nor to tell ron and hermione what
he had just seen. what was making harry feel so horrified and unhappy was not being shouted at
or having jars thrown at him; it was that he knew how it felt to be humiliated in the middle of a
circle of onlookers, knew exactly how snape had felt as his father had taunted him, and that
judging from what he had just seen, his father had been every bit as arrogant as snape had
always told him.
chapter twenty-nine
career advice
"but why haven't you got occlumency lessons any more?" said hermione, frowning.
"i've told you," harry muttered. "snape reckons i can carry on by myself now i've got the basics."
"so you've stopped having funny dreams?" said hermione skeptically.
"pretty much," said harry, not looking at her.
"well, i don't think snape should stop until you're absolutely sure you can control them!" said
hermione indignantly. "harry, i think you should go back to him and ask -"
"no," said harry forcefully. "just drop it, hermione, okay?"
it was the first day of the easter holidays and hermione, as was her custom, had spent a large
part of the day drawing up study schedule for the three of them. harry and ron had let her
do it; it was easier than arguing with her and, in any case, they might come in useful.
ron had been startled to discover there were only six weeks left until their exams.
"how can that come as a shock?" hermione demanded, as she tapped each little square on ron's
schedule with her wand so that it flashed a different color according to its subject.
"i dunno," said ron, "there's been a lot going on. "
"well, there you are," she said, handing him his timetable, "if you follow that you should do
fine."
ron looked down it gloomily, but then brightened.
"you've given me an evening off every week!"
"that's for quidditch practice," said hermione.
the smile faded from ron's face.
"what's the point?" he said dully. "we've got about as much chance of winning the quidditch
cup this year as dad's got of becoming minister for magic."
hermione said nothing; she was looking at harry, who was staring blankly at the opposite wall
of the common room while crookshanks pawed at his hand, trying to get his ears scratched.
"what's wrong, harry?"
"what?" he said quickly. "nothing."
he seized his copy of defensive magical theory and pretended to be looking something up in the index. crookshanks gave him up as a bad job and slunk away under hermione's chair.
"i saw cho earlier," said hermione tentatively. "she looked really miserable, too... have you two had a row again?"
"wha -- oh, yeah, we have," said harry, seizing gratefully on the excuse.
"what about?"
"that sneak friend of hers, marietta," said harry.
"yeah, well, i don't blame you!" said ron angrily, setting down his revision timetable. "if it
hadn't been for her..."
ron went into a rant about marietta edgecombe, which harry found helpful; all he had to do was
look angry, nod and say "yeah" and "that's right" whenever ron drew breath, leaving his mind
free to dwell, ever more miserably, on what he had seen in the pensieve.
he felt as though the memory of it was eating him from inside. he had been so sure his parents
were wonderful people that he had never had the slightest difficulty in disbelieving the
aspersions snape cast on his father's character. hadn't people like hagrid and sirius told harry
how wonderful his father had been? (yeah, well, look what sirius was like himself, said a
nagging voice inside harry's head... he was as bad, wasn't he?) yes, he had once overheard
professor mcgonagall saying that his father and sirius had been troublemakers at school, but she
had described them as forerunners of the weasley twins, and harry could not imagine fred and
george dangling someone upside-down for the fun of it... not unless they really loathed them...
perhaps malfoy, or somebody who really deserved it...
harry tried to make a case for snape having deserved what he had suffered at james's hands: but
hadn't lily asked, "what's he done to you?" and hadn't james replied, "it's more the fact that he exists, if you know what i mean." hadn't james started it all simply because sirius had said he was bored? harry remembered lupin saying back in grimmauld place that dumbledore had
made him prefect in the hope that he would be able to exercise some control over james and
sirius... but in the pensieve, he had sat there and let it all happen...
harry kept reminding himself that lily had intervened; his mother had been decent. yet, the
memory of the look on her face as she had shouted at james disturbed him quite as much as
anything else; she had clearly loathed james, and harry simply could not understand how they
could have ended up married. once or twice he even wondered whether james had forced her
into it...
for nearly five years the thought of his father had been a source of comfort, of inspiration.
whenever someone had told him he was like james, he had glowed with pride inside. and
now... now he felt cold and miserable at the thought of him.
the weather grew breezier, brighter and warmer as the easter holidays passed, but harry, along
with the rest of the fifth- and seventh-years, was trapped inside, traipsing back and forth
to the library. harry pretended his bad mood had no other cause but the approaching exams, and
as his fellow gryffindors were sick of studying themselves, his excuse went unchallenged.
"harry, i'm talking to you, can you hear me?"
"huh?"
he looked round. ginny weasley, looking very windswept, had joined him at the library table
where he had been sitting alone. it was late on sunday evening: hermione had gone back to
gryffindor tower to review ancient runes, and ron had quidditch practice.
"oh, hi," said h now, because the burrow had replaced number twelve, grimmauld place as the headquarters. mr. weasley had explained that after the death of dumbledore, their secret-keeper, each of the people to whom dumbledore had confided grimmauld place's location had become a secret-keeper in turn.
"and as there are around twenty of us, that greatly dilutes the power of the fidelius charm. twenty times as many opportunities for the death eaters to get the secret out of somebody. we can't expect it to hold much longer."
"but surely snape will have told the death eaters the address by now?" asked harry.
"well, mad-eye set up a couple of curses against snape in case he turns up there again. we hope they'll be strong enough both to keep him out and to bind his tongue if he tries to talk about the place, but we can't be sure. it would have been insane to keep using the place as headquarters now that its protection has become so shaky."
the kitchen was so crowded that evening it was difficult to maneuver knives and forks. harry found himself crammed beside ginny; the unsaid things that had just passed between them made him wish they had been separated by a few more people. he was trying so hard to avoid brushing her arm he could barely cut his chicken.
"no news about mad-eye?" harry asked bill.
"nothing," replied bill.
they had not been able to hold a funeral for moody, because bill and lupin had failed to recover his body. it had been difficult to know where he might have fallen, given the darkness and the confusion of the battle.
"the daily prophet hasn't said a word about him dying or about finding the body," bill went on. "but that doesn't mean much. it's keeping a lot quiet these days."
"and they still haven't called a hearing about all the underage magic i used escaping the death eaters?" harry called across the table to mr. weasley, who shook his head.
"because they know i had no choice or because they don't want me to tell the world voldemort attacked me?"
"the latter, i think. scrimgeour doesn't want to admit that you-know-who is as powerful as he is, nor that azkaban's seen a mass breakout."
"yeah, why tell the public the truth?" said harry, clenching his knife so tightly that the faint scars on the back of his right hand stood out, white against his skin: i must not tell lies.
"isn't anyone at the ministry prepared to stand up to him?" asked ron angrily.
"of course, ron, but people are terrified," mr. weasley replied, "terrified that they will be next to disappear, their children the next to be attacked! there are nasty rumors going around; i for one don't believe the muggle studies professor at hogwarts resigned. she hasn't been seen for weeks now. meanwhile scrimgeour remains shut up in his office all day; i just hope he's working on a plan."
there was a pause in which mrs. weasley magicked the empty plates onto the work surface and served apple tart.
"we must decide 'ow you will be disguised, 'arry," said fleur, once everyone had pudding. "for ze wedding," she added, when he looked confused. "of course, none of our guests are death eaters, but we cannot guarantee zat zey will not let something slip after zey 'ave 'ad champagne."
from this, harry gathered that she still suspected hagrid.
"yes, good point," said mrs. weasley from the top of the table where she sat, spectacles perched on the end of her nose, scanning an immense list of jobs that she had scribbled on a very long piece of parchment. "now, ron, have you cleaned out your room yet?"
"why?" exclaimed ron, slamming his spoon down and glaring at his mother. "why does my room have to be cleaned out? harry and i are fine with it the way it is!"
"we are holding your brother's wedding here in a few days' time, young man -"
"and are they getting married in my bedroom?" asked ron furiously. "no! so why in the name of merlin's saggy left -"
"don't talk to your mother like that," said mr. weasley firmly. "and do as you're told."
ron scowled at both his parents, then picked up his spoon and attacked the last few mouthfuls of his apple tart.
"i can help, some of it's my mess." harry told ron, but mrs. weasley cut across him.
"no, harry, dear, i'd much rather you helped arthur much out the chickens, and hermione, i'd be ever so grateful if you'd change the sheets for monsieur and madame delacour; you know they're arriving at eleven tomorrow morning."
but as it turned out, there was very little to do for the chickens. "there's no need to, er, mention it to molly," mr. weasley told harry, blocking his access to the coop, "but, er, ted tonks sent me most of what was left of sirius's bike and, er, i'm hiding - that's to say, keeping - it in here. fantastic stuff: there's an exhaust gaskin, as i believe it's called, the most magnificent battery, and it'll be a great opportunity to find out how brakes work. i'm going to try and put it all back together again when molly's not - i mean, when i've got time."
when they returned to the house, mrs. weasley was nowhere to be seen, so harry slipped upstairs to ron's attic bedroom.
"i'm doing it, i'm doing - ! oh, it's you," said ron in relief, as harry entered the room. ron lay back down on the bed, which he had evidently just vacated. the room was just as messy as it had been all week; the only chance was that hermione was now sitting in the far corner, her fluffy ginger cat, crookshanks, at her feet, sorting books, some of which harry recognized as his own, into two enormous piles.
"hi, harry," she said, as he sat down on his camp bed.
"and how did you manage to get away?"
"oh, ron's mum forgot that she asked ginny and me to change the sheets yesterday," said hermione. she threw numerology and grammatica onto one pile and the rise and fall of the dark arts onto the other.
"we were just talking about mad-eye," ron told harry. "i reckon he might have survived."
"but bill saw him hit by the killing curse," said harry.
"yeah, but bill was under attack too," said ron. "how can he be sure what he saw?"
"even if the killing curse missed, mad-eye still fell about a thousand feet," said hermione, now weight quidditch teams of britain and ireland in her hand.
"he could have used a shield charm -"
"fleur said his wand was blasted out of his hand," said harry.
"well, all right, if you want him to be dead," said ron grumpily, punching his pillow into a more comfortable shape.
"of course we don't want him to be dead!" said hermione, looking shocked. "it's dreadful that he's dead! but we're being realistic!"
for the first time, harry imagined mad-eye's body, broken as dumbledore's had been, yet with that one eye still whizzing in its socket. he felt a stab of revulsion mixed with a bizarre desire to laugh.
"the death eaters probably tidied up after themselves, that's why no one's found him," said ron wisely.
"yeah," said harry. "like barty crouch, turned into a bone and buried in hagrid's front garden. they probably transfigured moody and stuffed him -"
"don't!" squealed hermione. startled, harry looked over just in time to see her burst into tears over her copy of spellman's syllabary.
"oh no," said harry, struggling to get up from the old camp bed. "hermione, i wasn't trying to upset -"
but with a great creaking of rusty bedsprings, ron bounded off the bed and got there first. one arm around hermione, he fished in his jeans pocket and withdrew a revolting-looking handkerchief that he had used to clean out the oven earlier. hastily pulling out his wand, he pointed it at the rag and said, "tergeo."
the wand siphoned off most of the grease. looking rather pleased with himself, ron handed the slightly smoking handkerchief to hermione.
"oh . . . thanks, ron. . . . i'm sorry. . . ." she blew her nose and hiccupped. "it's just so awf-ful, isn't it? r-right after dumbledore . . . i j-just n-never imagined mad-eye dying, somehow, he seemed so tough!"
"yeah, i know," said ron, giving her a squeeze. "but you know what he'd say to us if he was here?"
"'c-constant vigilance,'" said hermione, mopping her eyes.
"that's right," said ron, nodding. "he'd tell us to learn from what happened to him. and what i've learned is not to trust that cowardly little squit, mundungus."
hermione gave a shaky laugh and leaned forward to pick up two more books. a second later, ron had snatched his arm back from around her shoulders; she had dropped the monster of monsters on his foot. the book had broken free from its restraining belt and snapped viciously at ron's ankle.
"i'm sorry, i'm sorry!" hermione cried as harry wrenched the book from ron's leg and retied it shit.
"what are you doing with all those books anyway?" ron asked, limping back to his bed.
"just trying to decide which ones to take with us," said hermione, "when we're looking for the horcruxes."
"oh, of course," said ron, clapping a hand to his forehead. "i forgot we'll be hunting down voldemort in a mobile library."
"ha ha," said hermione, looking down at spellman's syllabary. "i wonder . . . will we need to translate runes? it's possible. . . . i think we'd better take it, to be safe."
she dropped the syllabary onto the larger of the two piles and picked up hogwarts, a history.
"listen," said harry.
he had sat up straight. ron and hermione looked at him with similar mixtures of resignation and defiance.
"i know you said after dumbledore's funeral that you wanted to come with me," harry began.
"here he goes," ron said to hermione, rolling his eyes.
"as we knew he would," he sighed, turning back to the books. "you know, i think i will take hogwarts, a history. even if we're not going back there, i don't think i'd feel right if i didn't have it with -"
"listen!" said harry again.
"no, harry, you listen," said hermione. "we're coming with you. that was decided months ago - years, really."
"but -"
"shut up," ron advised him.
"- are you sure you've thought this through?" harry persisted.
"let's see," said hermione, slamming travels with trolls onto the discarded pile with a rather fierce look. "i've been packing foought of ginny, and fear bubbled like acid in his stomach.
"come on, i think we ought to keep moving," said hermione.
they moved back up the side street and onto the main road again, where a group of men on the opposite side was singing and weaving across the pavement.
"just as a matter of interest, why tottenham court road?" ron asked hermione.
"i've no idea, it just popped into my head, but i'm sure we're safer out in the muggle world, it's not where they'll expect us to be."
"true," said ron, looking around, "but don't you feel a bit - exposed?"
"where else is there?" asked hermione, cringing as the men on the other side of the road started wolf-whistling at her. "we can hardly book rooms at the leaky cauldron, can we? and grimmauld place is out if snape can get in there. . . . i suppose we could try my parents' home, though i think there's a chance they might check there. . . . oh, i wish they'd shut up!"
"all right, darling?" the drunkest of the men on the other pavement was yelling. "fancy a drink? ditch ginger and come and have a pint!"
"let's sit down somewhere," hermione said hastily as ron opened his mouth to shout back across the road. "look, this will do, in here!"
it was a small and shabby all-night café. a light layer of grease lay on all the formica-topped tables, but it was at least empty. harry slipped into a booth first and ron sat next to him opposite hermione, who had her back to the entrance and did not like it: she glanced over her shoulder so frequently she appeared to have a twitch. harry did not like being stationary; walking had given the illusion that they had a goal. beneath the cloak he could feel the last vestiges of polyjuice leaving him, his hands returning to their usual length and shape. he pulled his glasses out of his pocket and put them on again.
after a minute or two, ron said, "you know, we're not far from the leaky cauldron here, it's only in charing cross -"
"ron, we can't!" said hermione at once.
"not to stay there, but to find out what's going on!"
"we know what's going on! voldemort's taken over the ministry, what else do we need to know?"
"okay, okay, it was just an idea!" they relapsed into a prickly silence. the gum-chewing waitress shuffled over and hermione ordered two cappuccinos: as harry was invisible, it would have looked odd to order him one. a pair of burly workmen entered the café and squeezed into the next booth. hermione dropped her voice to a whisper.
"i say we find a quiet place to disapparate and head for the countryside. once we're there, we could send a message to the order."
"can you do that talking patronus thing, then?" asked ron.
"i've been practicing and i think so," said hermione.
"well, as long as it doesn't get them into trouble, though they might've been arrested already. god, that's revolting," ron added after one sip of the foamy, grayish coffee. the waitress had heard; she shot ron a nasty look as she shuffled off to take the new customers' orders. the larger of the two workmen, who was blond and quite huge, now that harry came to look at him, waved her away. she stared, affronted.
"let's get going, then, i don't want to drink this muck," said ron. "hermione, have you got muggle money to pay for this?"
"yes, i took out all my building society savings before i came to the burrow. i'll bet all the change is at the bottom," sighed hermione, reaching for her beaded bag.
the two workmen made identical movements, and harry mirrored them without conscious thought: all three of them drew their wands. ron, a few seconds late in realizing what was going on, lunged across the table, pushing hermione sideways onto her bench. the force of the death eaters' spells shattered the tiled wall where ron's head had just been, as harry, still invisible, yelled, "stupefy!"
the great blond death eater was hit in the face by a jet of red light: he slumped sideways, unconscious. his companion, unable to see who had cast the spell, fired another at ron: shining black ropes flew from his wand-tip and bound ron head to foot - the waitress screamed and ran for the door - harry sent another stunning spell at the death eater with the twisted face who had tied up ron, but the spell missed, rebounded on the window, and hit the waitress, who collapsed in front of the door.
"expulso!" bellowed the death eater, and the table behind which harry was standing blew up: the force of the explosion slammed him into the wall and he felt his wand leave his hand as the cloak slipped off him.
"petrificus totalus!" screamed hermione from out of sight, and the death eater fell forward like a statue to land with a crunching thud on the mess of broken china, table, and coffee. hermione crawled out from underneath the bench, shaking bits of glass ashtray out of her hair and trembling all over.
"d-diffindo," she said, pointing her wand at ron, who roared in pain as she slashed open the knee of his jeans, leaving a deep cut. "oh, i'm so sorry, ron, my hand's shaking! diffindo!"
the severed ropes fell away. ron got to his feet, shaking his arms to regain feeling in them. harry picked up his wand and climbed over all the debris to where the large blond death eater was sprawled across the bench.
"i should've recognized him, he was there the night dumbledore died," he said. he turned over the darker death eater with his foot; the man's eyes moved rapidly between harry, ron and hermione.
"that's dolohov," said ron. "i recognize him from the old wanted posters. i think the big one's thorfinn rowle."
"never mind what they're called!" said hermione a little hysterically. "how did they find us? what are we going to do?"
somehow her panic seemed to clear harry's head.
"lock the door," he told her, "and ron, turn out the lights."
he looked down at the paralyzed dolohov, thinking fast as the lock clicked and ron used the deluminator to plunge the café into darkness. harry could hear the men who had jeered at hermione earlier, yelling at another girl in the distance.
"what are we going to do with them?" ron whispered to harry through the dark; then, even more quietly, "kill them? they'd kill us. they had a good go just now."
hermione shuddered and took a step backward. harry shook his head.
"we just need to wipe their memories," said harry. "it's better like that, it'll throw them off the scent. if we killed them it'd be obvious we were here."
"you're the boss," said ron, sounding profoundly relieved. "but i've never down a memory charm."
"nor have i," said hermione, "but i know the theory."
she took a deep, calming breath, then pointed her wand at dolohov's forehead and said, "obliviate."
at once, dolohov's eyes became unfocused and dreamy.
"brilliant!" said harry, clapping her on the back. "take care of the other one and the waitress while ron and i clear up." "clear up?" said ron, looking around at the partly destroyed café. "why?"
"don't you think they might wonder what's happened if they wake up and find themselves in a place that looks like it's just been bombed?"
"oh right, yeah . . ."
ron struggled for a moment before managing to extract his wand from his pocket.
"it's no wonder i can't get it out, hermione, you packed my old jeans, they're tight."
"oh, i'm so sorry," hissed hermione, and as she dragged the waitress out of sight of the windows, harry heard her mutter a suggestion as to where ron could stick his wand instead.
once the café was restored to its previous condition, they heaved the death eaters back into their booth and propped them up facing each other. "but how did they find us?" hermione asked, looking from one inert man to the other. "how did they know where we were?"
she turned to harry.
"you - you don't think you've still got your trace on you, do you, harry?"
"he can't have," said ron. "the trace breaks at seventeen, that's wizarding law, you can't put it on an adult."
"as far as you know," said hermione. "what if the death eaters have found a way to put it on a seventeen-year-old?"
"but harry hasn't been near a death eater in the last twenty-four hours. who's supposed to have put a trace back on him?"
hermione did not reply. harry felt contaminated, tainted: was that really how the death eaters had found them?
"if i can't use magic, and you can't use magic near me, without us giving away our position - " he began.
"we're not splitting up!" said hermione firmly.
"we need a safe place to hide," said ron. "give us time to think things through."
"grimmauld place," said harry.
the other two gaped.
"don't be silly, harry, snape can get in there!"
"ron's dad said they've put up jinxes against him - and even if they haven't worked," he pressed on as hermione began to argue "so what? i swear, i'd like nothing better than to meet snape!"
"but -"
"hermione, where else is there? it's the best chance we've got. snape's only one death eater. if i've still got the trace on me, we'll have whole crowds of them on us wherever else we go."
she could not argue, though she looked as if she would have liked to. while she unlocked the café door, ron clicked the deluminator to release the café's light. then, on harry's count of three, they reversed the spells upon their three victims, and before the waitress or either of the death eaters could do more than stir sleepily, harry, ron and hermione had turned on the spot and vanished into the compressing darkness once more.
seconds later harry's lungs expanded gratefully and he opened his eyes: they were now standing in the middle of a familiar small and shabby square. tall, dilapidated houses looked down on them from every side. number twelve was visible to them, for they had been told of its existence by dumbledore, its secret-keeper, and they rushed toward it, checking every few yards that they were not being followed or observed. they raced up the stone steps, and harry tapped the front door once with his wand. they heard a series of metallic clicks and the clatter of a chain, then the door swung open with a creak and they hurried over the thresho, sir, or
else as the room of requirement!"
"why?" said harry curiously.
"because it is a room that a person can only enter," said dobby seriously, "when they have real
need of it. sometimes it is there, and sometimes it is not, but when it appears, it is always
equipped for the seeker's needs. dobby has used it, sir," said the elf, dropping his voice and
looking guilty, "when winky has been very drunk; he has hidden her in the room of
requirement and he has found antidotes to butterbeer there, and a nice elf-sized bed to settle her
on while she sleeps it off, sir... and dobby knows mr. filch has found extra cleaning materials
there when he has run short, sir, and -"
"and if you really needed a bathroom," said harry, suddenly remembering something
dumbledore had said at the yule ball the previous christmas, "would it fill itself with chamber
pots?"
"dobby expects so, sir," said dobby, nodding earnestly. "it is a most amazing room, sir."
"how many people know about it?" said harry, sitting up straighter in his chair.
"very few, sir. mostly people stumbles across it when they needs it, sir, but often they never
finds it again, for they do not know that it is always there waiting to be called into service, sir."
"it sounds brilliant," said harry, his heart racing. "it sounds perfect, dobby. when can you show me where it is?"
"any time, harry potter, sir," said dobby, looking delighted at harrys enthusiasm. "we could go
now, if you like!"
for a moment harry was tempted to go with dobby. he was halfway out of his seat, intending to
hurry upstairs for his invisibility cloak when, not for the first time, a voice very much like
hermione's whispered in his ear: reckless. it was, after all, very late, he was exhausted, and had
snape's essay to finish.
"not tonight, dobby," said harry reluctantly, sinking back into his chair. "this is really
important... i don't want to blow it, it'll need proper planning. listen, can you just tell me
exactly where this room of requirement is, and how to get in there?"
their robes billowed and swirled around them as they splashed across the flooded vegetable
patch to double herbology, where they could hardly hear what professor sprout was saying over
the hammering of raindrops hard as hailstones on the greenhouse roof. the afternoons care of
magical creatures lesson was to be relocated from the storm-swept grounds to a free classroom
on the ground floor and, to their intense relief, angelina had sought out her team at lunch to tell
them that quidditch practice was cancelled.
"good," said harry quietly, when she told him, "because we've found somewhere to have our
first defense meeting. tonight, eight o'clock, seventh floor opposite that tapestry of barnabas
the barmy being clubbed by those trolls. can you tell katie and alicia?"
she looked slightly taken aback but promised to tell the others. harry returned hungrily to his
sausages and mash. when he looked up to take a drink of pumpkin juice, he found hermione
watching him.
"what?" he said thickly.
"well... it's just that dobby's plans aren't always that safe. don't you remember when he lost
you all the bones in your arm?"
"this room isn't just some mad idea of dobby's; dumbledore knows about it, too, he mentioned
it to me at the yule ball."
hermione's expression cleared.
"dumbledore told you about it?"
"just in passing," said harry, shrugging.
"oh, well, that's all right then," said hermione briskly and raised no more objections.
together with ron they had spent most of the day seeking out those people who had signed their
names to the list in the hog's head and telling them where to meet that evening. somewhat to
harry's disappointment, it was ginny who managed to find cho chang and her friend first;
however, by the end of dinner he was confident that the news had been passed to every one of
the twenty-five people who had turned up in the hog's head.
at half past seven harry, ron and hermione left the gryffindor common room, harry clutching
a certain piece of aged parchment in his hand. fifth-years were allowed to be out in the corridors
until nine o'clock, but all three of them kept looking around nervously as they made their way
along the seventh floor.
"hold it," harry warned, unfolding the piece of parchment at the top of the last staircase, tapping
it with his wand and muttering, "i solemnly swear that i am up to no good."
a map of hogwarts appeared on the blank surface of the parchment. tiny black moving dots,
labeled with names, showed where various people were.
"filch is on the second floor," said harry, holding the map close to his eyes, "and mrs. norris is
on the fourth."
"and umbridge?" said hermione anxiously.
"in her office," said harry, pointing. "okay, lets go."
they hurried along the corridor to the place dobby had described to harry, a stretch of blank
wall opposite an enormous tapestry depicting barnabas the barmy's foolish attempt to train trolls
for the ballet.
"okay," said harry quietly, while a moth-eaten troll paused in his relentless clubbing of the would be ballet teacher to watch them. "dobby said to walk past this bit of wall three times,
concentrating hard on what we need."
they did so, turning sharply at the window just beyond the blank stretch of wall, then at the man-sized vase on its other side. ron had screwed up his eyes in concentration; hermione was
whispering something under her breath; harry's fists were clenched as he stared ahead of him.
we need somewhere to learn to fight... he thought. just give us a place to practice... somewhere they can't find us...
"harry!" said hermione sharply, as they wheeled around after their third walk past.
a highly polished door had appeared in the wall. ron was staring at it, looking slightly wary.
harry reached out, seized the brass handle, pulled open the door and led the way into a spacious
room lit with flickering torches like those that illuminated the dungeons eight floors below.
the walls were lined with wooden bookcases and instead of chairs there were large silk cushions
on the floor. a set of shelves at the far end of the room carried a range of instruments such as
sneakoscopes, secrecy sensors and a large, cracked foe-glass that harry was sure had hung, the
previous year, in the fake moodys office.
"these will be good when we're practicing stunning, " said ron enthusiastically, prodding one of the cushions with his foot.
"and just look at these books!" said hermione excitedly, running a finger along the spines of the
large leather-bound tomes. "a compendium of common curses and their counter-actions...
the dark arts outsmarted... self-defensive spellwork... wow..." she looked around at harry,
her face glowing, and he saw that the presence of hundreds of books had finally convinced
hermione that what they were doing was right. "harry, this is wonderful, there's everything we
need here!"
and without further ado she slid 'jinxes for the jinxed' from its shelf, sank on to the nearest
cushion and began to read.
there was a gentle knock on the door. harry looked round. ginny, neville, lavender, parvati
and dean had arrived.
"whoa," said dean, staring around, impressed. "what is this place?"
harry began to explain, but before he had finished more people had arrived and he had to start all
over again. by the time eight o'clock arrived, every cushion was occupied. harry moved across
to the door and turned the key protruding from the lock; it clicked in a satisfyingly loud way and
everybody fell silent, looking at him. hermione carefully marked her page of 'jinxes for the
jinxed' and set the book aside.
"well," said harry, slightly nervously. "this is the place we've found for practice sessions, and
you've - er - obviously found it okay."
"it's fantastic!" said cho, and several people murmured their agreement.
"it's bizarre," said fred, frowning around at it. "we once hid from filch in here, remember,
george? but it was just a broom cupboard then."
"hey, harry, what's this stuff?" asked dean from the rear of the room, indicating the
sneakoscopes and the foe-glass.
"dark detectors," said harry, stepping between the cushions to reach them. "basically they all
show when dark wizards or enemies are around, but you don't want to rely on them too much,
they can be fooled..."
he gazed for a moment into the cracked foe-glass; shadowy figures were moving around inside
it, though none was recognizable. he turned his back on it.
"well, i've been thinking about the sort of stuff we ought to do first and - er -" he noticed a
raised hand. "what, hermione?"
"i think we ought to elect a leader," said hermione.
"harry's leader," said cho at once, looking at hermione as though she were mad.
harrys stomach did yet another back-flip.
"yes, but i think we ought to vote on it properly," said hermione, unperturbed. "it makes it
formal and it gives him authority. so - everyone who thinks harry ought to be our leader?"
everybody put up their hand, even zacharias smith, though he did it very half-heartedly.
"er - right, thanks," said harry, who could feel his face burning. "and -what, hermione?"
"i also think we ought to have a name," she said brightly, her hand still in the air. "it would
promote a feeling of team spirit and unity, don't you think?"
"can we be the anti-umbridge league?" said angelina hopefully.
"or the ministry of magic are morons group?" suggested fred.
"i was thinking," said hermione, frowning at fred, "more of a name that didn't tell everyone
what we were up to, so we can refer to it safely outside meetings."
"the defense association?" said cho. "the d.a. for short, so nobody knows what we're talking
about?"
"yeah, the d.a.'s good," said ginny. "only let's make it stand for dumbledores army, because
that's the ministry's worst fear, isn't it?"
there was a good deal of appreciative murmuring and laughter at this.
"all in favor of the d.a.?" said hermione bossily, kneeling up on her cushion to count. "that's a
majority - motion passed!"
she pinned the piece of parchment 

ron snapped. before malfoy knew what was happening, ron was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground. neville hesitated, then clambered over the back of his seat to help. 

"come on, harry!" hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as harry sped straight at snape -- she didn't even notice malfoy and ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was neville, crabbe, and goyle. 

up in the air, snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches -- the next second, harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the snitch clasped in his hand. 

the stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember the snitch being caught so quickly. 

"ron! ron! where are you? the game's over! harry's won! we've won! gryffindor is in the lead!" shrieked hermione, dancing up and down on her seat and hugging parvati patil in the row in front. 

harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. he couldn't believe it. he'd done it -- the game was over; it had barely lasted five minutes. as gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw snape land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped -- then harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into dumbledore's smiling face. 

"well done," said dumbledore quietly, so that only harry could hear. 

"nice to see you haven't been brooding about that mirror... been keeping busy... excellent..." 

snape spat bitterly on the ground. 

harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his nimbus two thousand back to the broomshed. he couldn't ever remember feeling happier. he'd really done something to be proud of now -- no one could say he was just a famous name any more. the evening air had never smelled so sweet. he walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur: gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; ron and hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed. 

harry had reached the shed. he leaned against the wooden door and looked up at hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun. 

gryffindor in the lead. he'd done it, he'd shown snape.... 

and speaking of snape... 

a hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle. clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest. harry's victory faded from his mind as he watched. he recognized the figure's prowling walk. snape, sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner -- what was going on? harry jumped back on his nimbus two thousand and took off. gliding silently over the castle he saw snape enter the forest at a run. he followed. 

the trees were so thick he couldn't see where snape had gone. he flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices. he glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree. 

he climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through the leaves. below, in a shadowy clearing, stood snape, but he wasn't alone. quirrell was there, too. 

harry couldn't make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering worse than ever. harry strained to catch what they were saying. 

"... d-don't know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places, severus..." 

"oh, i thought we'd keep this private," said snape, his voice icy. 

"students aren't supposed to know about the sorcerer's stone, after all." 

harry leaned forward. quirrell was mumbling something. snape interrupted him. 

"have you found out how to get past that beast of hagrid's yet?" 

"b-b-but severus, i --" 

"you don't want me as your enemy, quirrell," said snape, taking a step toward him. 

"i-i don't know what you "you know perfectly well what i mean." 

an owl hooted loudly, and harry nearly fell out of the tree. he steadied himself in time to hear snape say, "-- your little bit of hocus-pocus. 

i'm waiting." 

"b-but i d-d-don't --" 

"very well," snape cut in. "we'll have another little chat soon, when you've had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie." 

he threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing. it was almost dark now, but harry could see quirrell, standing quite still as though he was petrified. 

"harry, where have you been?" hermione squeaked. 

"we won! you won! we won!" shouted ron, thumping harry on the back. "and i gave malfoy a black eye, and neville tried to take on crabbe and goyle single-handed! he's still out cold but madam pomftey says he'll be all right - talk about showing slytherin! everyone's waiting for you in the common room, we're having a party, fred and george stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens." 

"never mind that now," said harry breathlessly. "let's find an empty room, you wait 'til you hear this...." 

he made sure peeves wasn't inside before shutting the door behind them, then he told them what he'd seen and heard. 

"so we were right, it is the sorcerer's stone, and snape's trying to force quirrell to help him get it. he asked if he knew how to get past fluffy - and he said something about quirrell's 'hocus pocuss-- i reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and quirrell would have done some anti-dark arts spell that snape needs to break through --" 

"so you mean the stone's only safe as long as quirrell stands up to snape?" said hermione in alarm. 

"it'll be gone by next tuesday," said ron. 

chapter fourteen 

norbert the norwegian ridgeback 

quirrell, however, must have been braver than they'd thought. in the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it didn't look as though he'd cracked yet. 

every time they passed the third-floor corridor, harry, ron, and hermione would press their ears to the door to check that fluffy was still growling inside. snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which surely meant that the stone was still safe. whenever harry passed quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and ron had started telling people off for laughing at quirrell's stutter. 

hermione, however, had more on her mind than the sorcerer's stone. she had started drawing up study schedules and colorcoding all her notes. 

harry and ron wouldn't have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same. 

"hermione, the exams are ages away." 

"ten weeks," hermione snapped. "that's not ages, that's like a second to nicolas flamel." 

"but we're not six hundred years old," ron reminded her. "anyway, what are you studying for, you already know it a." 

"what am i studying for? are you crazy? you realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year? they're very important, i should have started studying a month ago, i don't know what's gotten into me...." 

unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as hermione. they piled so much homework on them that the easter holidays weren't nearly as much fun as the christmas ones. it was hard to relax with hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon's blood or practicing wand movements. moaning and yawning, harry and ron spent most of their free time in the library with her, trying to get through all their extra work. 

"i'll never remember this," ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window. it was the first really fine day they'd had in months. the sky was a clear, forget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming. 

harry, who was looking up "dittany" in one thousand magical herbs and fungi, didn't look up until he heard ron say, "hagrid! what are you doing in the library?" 

hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind his back. he looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat. 

"jus' lookin'," he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at once. "an' what're you lot up ter?" he looked suddenly suspicious. "yer not still lookin' fer nicolas flamel, are yeh?" "oh, we found out who he is ages ago," said ron impressively. "and we know what that dog's guarding, it's a sorcerer's st --" 

"shhhh!" hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening. 

"don' go shoutin' about it, what's the matter with yeh?" 

"there are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact," said harry, "about what's guarding the stone apart from fluffy --" 

"shhhh!" said hagrid again. "listen - come an' see me later, i'm not promisin' i'll tell yeh anythin', mind, but don' go rabbitin' about it in here, students aren' s'pposed ter know. they'll think i've told yeh --" 

"see you later, then," said harry. 

hagrid shuffled off. 

"what was he hiding behind his back?" said hermione thoughtfully. 

"do you think it had anything to do with the stone?" 

"i'm going to see what section he was in," said ron, who'd had enough of working. he came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table. 

"dragons!" he whispered. "hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons! look at these: dragon species of great britain and ireland; from egg to inferno, a dragon keeper's guide." 

"hagrid's always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time i ever met him, " said harry. 

"but it's against our laws," said ron. "dragon breeding was outlawed by the warlocks' convention of 1709, everyone knows that. it's hard to stop muggles from noticing us if we're keeping dragons in the back garden - anyway, you can't tame dragons, it's dangerous. you should see the burns charlie's got off wild ones in romania." 

"but there aren't wild dragons in britain?" said harry. 

"of course there are," said ron. "common welsh green and hebridean blacks. the ministry of magic has a job hushing them up, i can tell you. 

our kind have to keep putting spells on muggles who'vbby merely bounced off the stone, cushioned by his eight hats. hermione and a few of the other girls let out squeaks of fear and sympathy.
"what's happened, dobby?" harry asked, grabbing the elf's tiny arm and holding him away from anything with which he might seek to hurt himself.
"harry potter... she... she..."
dobby hit himself hard on the nose with his free fist. harry seized that, too.
"who's 'she', dobby?"
but he thought he knew; surely only one 'she' could induce such fear in dobby? the elf looked
up at him, slightly cross-eyed, and mouthed wordlessly.
"umbridge?" asked harry, horrified.
dobby nodded, then tried to bang his head on harry's knees. harry held him at arm's length.
"what about her? dobby - she hasn't found out about this - about us - about the d.a.?"
he read the answer in the elf's stricken face. his hands held fast by harry, the elf tried to kick
himself and fell to the floor.
"is she coming?" harry asked quietly.
dobby let out a howl, and began beating his bare feet hard on the floor.
"yes, harry potter, yes!"
harry straightened up and looked around at the motionless, terrified people gazing at the
thrashing elf.
"what are you waiting for?" harry bellowed. "run!"
they all pelted towards the exit at once, forming a scrum at the door, then people burst through.
harry could hear them sprinting along the corridors and hoped they had the sense not to try and
make it all the way to their dormitories. it was only ten to nine; if they just took refuge in the
library or the owlery, which were both nearer -
"harry, come on!" shrieked hermione from the center of the knot of people now fighting to get
out.
he scooped up dobby, who was still attempting to do himself serious injury, and ran with the elf
in his arms to join the back of the queue.
"dobby - this is an order - get back down to the kitchen with the other elves and, if she asks you
whether you warned me, lie and say no!" said harry. "and i forbid you to hurt yourself!" he
added, dropping the elf as he made it over the threshold at last and slammed the door behind him.
"thank you, harry potter!" squeaked dobby, and he streaked off. harry glanced left and right,
the others were all moving so fast he caught only glimpses of flying heels at either end of the
corridor before they vanished; he started to run right; there was a boys' bathroom up ahead, he
could pretend he'd been in there all the time if he could just reach it -
"aaargh!"
something caught him around the ankles and he fell spectacularly, skidding along on his front
for six feet before coming to a halt. someone behind him was laughing. he rolled over on to his
back and saw malfoy concealed in a niche beneath an ugly dragon-shaped vase.
"trip jinx, potter!" he said. "hey professor - professor! i've got one!"
umbridge came bustling round the far corner, breathless but wearing a delighted smile.
"it's him!" she said jubilantly at the sight of harry on the floor. "excellent, draco, excellent, oh,
very good - fifty points to slytherin! i'll take him from here... stand up, potter!"
harry got to his feet, glaring at the pair of them. he had never seen umbridge looking so happy.
she seized his arm in a vice-like grip and turned, beaming broadly, to malfoy.
"you hop along and see if you can round up any more of them, draco," she said. "tell the others
to look in the library - anybody out of breath - check the bathrooms, miss parkinson can do the
girls' ones - off you go - and you," she added in her softest, most dangerous voice, as malfoy
walked away, "you can come with me to the headmasters office, potter."
they were at the stone gargoyle within minutes. harry wondered how many of the others had
been caught. he thought of ron - mrs. weasley would kill him - and of how hermione would
feel if she was expelled before she could take her owls. and it had been seamus's very first
meeting... and neville had been getting so good...
"fizzing whizzbee," sang umbridge; the stone gargoyle jumped aside, the wall behind split
open, and they ascended the moving stone staircase. they reached the polished door with the
griffin knocker, but umbridge did not bother to knock, she strode straight inside, still holding
tight to harry.
the office was full of people. dumbledore was sitting behind his desk, his expression serene, the
tips of his long fingers together. professor mcgonagall stood rigidly beside him, her face
extremely tense. cornelius fudge, minister for magic, was rocking backwards and forwards on
his toes beside the fire, apparently immensely pleased with the situation; kingsley shacklebolt
and a tough-looking wizard with very short wiry hair whom harry did not recognize, were
positioned on either side of the door like guards, and the freckled, bespectacled form of percy
weasley hovered excitedly beside the wall, a quill and a heavy scroll of parchment in his hands,
apparently poised to take notes.
the portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses were not shamming sleep tonight. all of
them were alert and serious, watching what was happening below them. as harry entered, a few
flitted into neighboring frames and whispered urgently into their neighbor's ear.
harry pulled himself free of umbridge's grasp as the door swung shut behind them. cornelius
fudge was glaring at him with a kind of vicious satisfaction on his face.
"well," he said. "well, well, well..."
harry replied with the dirtiest look he could muster. his heart drummed madly inside him, but
his brain was oddly cool and clear.
"he was heading back to gryffindor tower," said umbridge. there was an indecent excitement
in her voice, the same callous pleasure harry had heard as she watched professor trelawney
dissolving with misery in the entrance hall. "the malfoy boy cornered him."
"did he, did he?" said fudge appreciatively. "i must remember to tell lucius. well, potter... i
expect you know why you are here?"
harry fully intended to respond with a defiant 'yes': his mouth had opened and the word was
half-formed when he caught sight of dumbledore's face. dumbledore was not looking directly at
harry - his eyes were fixed on a point just over his shoulder - but as harry stared at him, he
shook his head a fraction of an inch to each side.
harry changed direction mid-word.
"ye--no."
"i beg your pardon?" said fudge.
"no," said harry, firmly.
"you don't know why you are here?"
"no, i don't," said harry.
fudge looked incredulously from harry to professor umbridge. harry took advantage of his
momentary inattention to steal another quick look at dumbledore, who gave the carpet the tiniest
of nods and the shadow of a wink.
"so you have no idea," said fudge, in a voice positively sagging with sarcasm, "why professor
umbridge has brought you to this office? you are not aware that you have broken any school
rules?"
"school rules?" said harry. "no."
"or ministry decrees?" amended fudge angrily.
"not that i'm aware of," said harry blandly.
his heart was still hammering very fast. it was almost worth telling these lies to watch fudges
blood pressure rising, but he could not see how on earth he would get away with them; if
somebody had tipped off umbridge about the d.a. then he, the leader, might as well be packing
his trunk right now.
"so, it's news to you, is it," said fudge, his voice now thick with anger, "that an illegal student
organization has been discovered within this school?"
"yes, it is," said harry, hoisting an unconvincing look of innocent surprise on to his face.
"i think, minister," said umbridge silkily from beside him, "we might make better progress if i
fetch our informant."
"yes, yes, do," said fudge, nodding, and he glanced maliciously at dumbledore as umbridge left the room. "there's nothing like a good witness, is t here, dumbledore?"
"nothing at all, cornelius," said dumbledore gravely, inclining his head.
there was a wait of several minutes, in which nobody looked at each other, then harry heard the
door open behind him. umbridge moved past him into the room, gripping by the shoulder cho's
curly-haired friend, marietta, who was hiding her face in her hands.
"don't be scared, dear, don't be frightened," said professor umbridge softly, patting her on the
back, "it's quite all right, now. you have done the right thing. the minister is very pleased with
you. he'll be telling your mother what a good girl you've been.
"marietta's mother, minister," she added, looking up at fudge, "is madam edgecombe from the
department of magical transportation, floo network office - she's been helping us police the
hogwarts fires, you know."
"jolly good, jolly good!" said fudge heartily. "like mother, like daughter, eh? well, come on,
now, dear, look up, don't be shy, let's hear what you've got to - galloping gargoyles!"
as marietta raised her head, fudge leapt backwards in shock, nearly landing himself in the fire.
he cursed, and stamped on the hem of his cloak which had started to smoke. marietta gave a
wail and pulled the neck of her robes right up to her eyes, but not before everyone had seen that
her face was horribly disfigured by a series of close-set purple pustules that had spread across her
nose and cheeks to form the word sneak.
"never mind the spots now, dear," said umbridge impatiently, "just take your robes away from
your mouth and tell the minister -"
but marietta gave another muffled wail and shook her head frantically.
"oh, very well, you silly girl, i'll tell him," snapped umbridge. she hitched her sickly smile back on to her face and said, "well, minister, miss edgecombe here came to my office shortly after dinner this evening and told me she had something she wanted to tell me. she said that if i
proceeded to a secret room on the seventh floor, sometimes known as the room of requirement,
i would find out something to my advantage. i questioned her a little further and she admitted
that there was to be some kind of meeting there. unfortunately, at that point this hex," she waved
impatiently at marietta's concealed face, "came into opee ­­"

they turned into the corridor to gryffindor tower and saw neville longbottom, pleading with sir cadogan, who seemed to be refusing him entrance.

"i wrote them down!" neville was saying tearfully. "but i must've dropped them somewhere!"

"a likely tale!" roared sir cadogan. then, spotting harry and ron: "good even, my fine young yeomen! come clap this loon in irons. he is trying to force entry to the chambers within!"

"oh, shut up," said ron as he and harry drew level with neville.

"i've lost the passwords!" neville told them miserably. "i made him tell me what passwords he was going to use this week, because he keeps changing them, and now i don't know what i've done with them!"

"oddsbodikins," said harry to sir cadogan, who looked extremely disappointed and reluctantly swung forward to let them into the common room. there was a sudden, excited murmur as every head turned and the next moment, harry was surrounded by people exclaiming over his firebolt.

"where'd you get it, harry?"

"will you let me have a go?" "have you ridden it yet, harry?"

"ravenclaw'll have no chance, they're all on cleansweep sevens!"

 "can i just hold it, harry?"

after ten minutes or so, during which the firebolt was passed around and admired from every angle, the crowd dispersed and harry and ron had a clear view of hermione, the only person who hadn't rushed over to them,

bent over her work and carefully avoiding their eyes. harry and ron approached her table and at last, she looked up.

"i got it back," said harry, grinning at her and holding up the firebolt.

"see, hermione? there wasn't anything wrong with it!" said ron.

"well ­­ there might have been!" said hermione. "i mean, at least you know now that it's safe!"

"yeah, i suppose so," said harry. "id better put it upstairs."

"i'll take it!" said ron eagerly. "i've got to give scabbers his rat tonic."

he took the firebolt and, holding it as if it were made of glass,

carried it away up the boys' staircase.

"can i sit down, then?" harry asked hermione.

"i suppose so," said hermione, moving a great stack of parchment off a chair.

harry looked around at the cluttered table, at the long arithmancy essay on which the ink was still glistening, at the even longer muggle studies essay ("explain why muggles need electricity" and at the rune translation hermione was now poring over.

"how are you getting through all this stuff?" harry asked her.

"oh, well ­­ you know ­­ working hard," said hermione. close­up, harry saw that she looked almost as tired as lupin.

"why don't you just drop a couple of subjects?" harry asked, watching

her lifting books as she searched for her rune dictionary.

"i couldn't do that!" said hermione, looking scandalized.

"arithmancy looks terrible," said harry, picking up a very complicated­looking number chart.

"oh no, it's wonderful!" said hermione earnestly. "it's my favorite subject! it's ­­"

but exactly what was wonderful about arithmancy, harry never found out.

at that precise moment, a strangled yell echoed down the boys' staircase. the whole common room fell silent, staring, petrified, at the entrance. then came hurried footsteps, growing louder and louder ­­ and then ron came leaping into view, dragging with him a bedsheet.

"look!" he bellowed, striding over to hermione's table.

"look!" he yelled, shaking the sheets in her face.

"ron, what ­­?"

"scabbers! look! scabbers!"

hermione was leaning away from ron, looking utterly bewildered. harry looked down at the sheet ron was holding. there was something red on it.

something that looked horribly like ­­ "blood!" ron yelled into the stunned silence. "he's gone! and you know what was on the floor?"

"n ­­ no," said hermione in a trembling voice.

ron threw something down onto hermione's rune translation. hermione and harry leaned forward. lying on top of the weird, spiky shapes were several long, ginger cat hairs.

 chapter thirteen gryffindor versus ravenclaw

it looked like the end of ron and hermione's friendship. each was so angry with the other that harry couldn't see how they'd ever make up.

ron was enraged that hermione had never taken crookshanks's attempts to eat scabbers seriously, hadn't bothered to keep a close enough watch on him, and was still trying to pretend that crookshanks was innocent by suggesting that ron look for scabbers under all the boys' beds.

hermione, meanwhile, maintained fiercely that ron had no proof that crookshanks had eaten scabbers, that the ginger hairs might have been there since christmas, and that ron had been prejudiced against her cat ever since crookshanks had landed on ron's head in the magical menagerie.

personally, harry was sure that crookshanks had eaten scabbers, and when he tried to point out to hermione that the evidence all pointed that way, she lost her temper with harry too.

"okay, side with ron, i knew you would!" she said shrilly. "first the firebolt, now scabbers, everything's my fault, isn't it! just leave me alone, harry, i've got a lot of work to do!"

ron had taken the loss of his rat very hard indeed.

"come on, ron, you were always saying how boring scabbers was," said fred bracingly. "and he's been off­color for ages, he was wasting away.

it was probably better for him to snuff it quickly ­­ one swallow ­­ he probably didn't feel a thing."

"fred!" said ginny indignantly.

"all he did was eat and sleep, ron, you said it yourself," said george.

"he bit goyle for us once!" ron said miserably. "remember, harry?"

"yeah, that's true," said harry.

"his finest hour," said fred, unable to keep a straight face. "let the scar on goyle's finger stand as a lasting tribute to his memory. oh,

 come on, ron, get yourself down to hogsmeade and buy a new rat, what's the point of moaning?"

in a last­ditch attempt to cheer ron up, harry persuaded him to come along to the gryffindor team's final practice before the ravenclaw match, so that he could have a ride on the firebolt after they'd finished. this did seem to take ron's mind off scabbers for a moment ("great! can i try and shoot a few goals on it?") so they set off for the quidditch field together.

madam hooch, who was still overseeing gryffindor practices to keep an eye on harry, was just as impressed with the firebolt as everyone else had been. she took it in her hands before takeoff and gave them the benefit of her professional opinion.

"look at the balance on it! if the nimbus series has a fault, it's a slight list to the tail end ­­ you often find they develop a drag after a few years. they've updated the handle too, a bit slimmer than the cleansweeps, reminds me of the old silver arrows ­­ a pity they've stopped making them. i learned to fly on one, and a very fine old broom it was too...."

she continued in this vein for some time, until wood said, "er ­­ madam hooch? is it okay if harry has the firebolt back? we need to practice...."

"oh ­­ right ­­ here you are, then, potter," said madam hooch. "i'll sit over here with weasley...."

she and ron left the field to sit in the stadium, and the gryffindor team gathered around wood for his final instructions for tomorrow's match.

"harry, i've just found out who ravenclaw is playing as seeker. it's cho chang. she's a fourth year, and she's pretty good.... i really hoped she wouldn't be fit, she's had some problems with injuries...." wood scowled his displeasure that cho chang had made a full recovery, then said, "on the other hand, she rides a comet two sixty, which is going to look like a joke next to the firebolt." he gave harry's broom a look of fervent admiration, then said, "okay, everyone, let's go ­­ "

 and at long last, harry mounted his firebolt, and kicked off from the ground.

it was better than he'd ever dreamed. the firebolt turned with the lightest touch; it seemed to obey his thoughts rather than his grip; it sped across the field at such speed that the stadium turned into a green­and­gray blur; harry turned it so sharply that alicia spinnet screamed, then he went into a perfectly controlled dive, brushing the grassy field with his toes before rising thirty, forty, fifty feet into the air again.

"harry, i'm letting the snitch out!" wood called.

harry turned and raced a bludger toward the goal posts; he outstripped it easily, saw the snitch dart out from behind wood, and within ten seconds had caught it tightly in his hand.

the team cheered madly. harry let the snitch go again, gave it a minute's head start, then tore after it, weaving in and out of the others; he spotted it lurking near katie bell's knee, looped her easily,

and caught it again.

it was the best practice ever; the team, inspired by the presence of the firebolt in their midst, performed their best moves faultlessly, and by the time they hit the ground again, wood didn't have a single criticism to make, which, as george weasley pointed out, was a first.

"i can't see what's going to stop us tomorrow!" said wood. "not unless ­­ harry, you've sorted out your dementor problem, haven't you?"

"yeah," said harry, thinking of his feeble patronus and wishing it were stronger.

"the dementors won't turn up again, oliver. dumbledore'd go ballistic,"

said fred confidently.

"well, let's hope not," said wood. "anyway ­­ good work, everyone. let's get back to the tower... turn in early ­­"

 "i'm staying out for a bit; ron wants a go on the firebolt," harry told wood, and while the rest of the team headed off to the locker rooms,

harry strode over to ron, who vaulted the barrier to the stands and came to meet him. madam hooch had fallen asleep in her seat.

"here you go," said harry, handing ron the firebolt.

ron, an expression of ecstasy on his face, mounted the broom and zoomed off into the gathering darkness while harry walked around the edge of the field, watching him. night had fallen before madam hooch awoke with a start, told harry and ron off for not waking her, and insisted that they go back to the castle.

harry shouldered the f sound of hundreds of feet climbing the stairs, and the loud, happy
talk of well-fed people; next moment, students were crashing into the
passage from both ends.
the chatter, the bustle, the noise died suddenly as the people in front spotted
the hanging cat. harry, ron, and hermione stood alone, in the middle of the
corridor, as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to see
the grisly sight.
then someone shouted through the quiet.
"enemies of the heir, beware! you'll be next, mudbloods!"
it was draco malfoy. he had pushed to the front of the crowd, his cold eyes
alive, his usually bloodless face flushed, as he grinned at the sight of the
hanging, immobile cat.
c h a p t x ir n i n e
the wrtiting
on the wall
what's going on here? what's going on?" attracted no doubt by
malfoy's shout, argus filch came shouldering his way through the
crowd. then he saw mrs. norris and fell back, clutching his face in
horror.
"my cat! my cat! what's happened to mrs. norris?" he shrieked.
and his popping eyes fell on harry.
"you!"he screeched. "you! you've murdered my cat! you've
killed her! i'll kill you! i'll -"
"argus!"
dumbledore had arrived on the scene, followed by a number of other
117
teachers. in seconds, he had swept past harry, ron, and hermione
and detached mrs. norris from the torch bracket.
"come with me, argus," he said to filch. "you, too, mr. potter, mr.
weasley, miss granger."
lockhart stepped forward eagerly.
*140*
"my office is nearest, headmaster - just upstairs - please feel free -"
"thank you, gilderoy," said dumbledore.
the silent crowd parted to let them pass. lockhart, looking excited and
important, hurried after dumbledore; so did professors mcgonagall
and snape.
as they entered lockhart's darkened office there was a flurry of
movement across the walls; harry saw several of the lockharts in the
pictures dodging out of sight, their hair in rollers. the real lockhart lit
the candles on his desk and stood back. dumbledore lay mrs. norris
on the polished surface and began to examine her. harry, ron, and
hermione exchanged tense looks and sank into chairs outside the pool
of candlelight, watching.
the tip of dumbledore's long, crooked nose was barely an inch from
mrs. norris's fur. he was looking at her closely through his half-moon
spectacles, his long fingers gently prodding and poking. professor
mcgonagall was bent almost as close, her eyes narrowed. snape
loomed behind them, half in shadow, wearing a most peculiar
expression: it was as though he was trying hard not to smile. and
lockhart was hovering around all of them, making suggestions.
"it was definitely a curse that killed her - probably the transmogrifian
torture - i've seen it used many times, so unlucky i wasn't there, i
know the very countercurse that would have saved her . .....
lockhart's comments were punctuated by filch's dry, racking sobs.
he was slumped in a chair by the desk, unable to look at mrs. norris,
118
his face in his hands. much as he detested filch, harry
*141*
couldn't help feeling a bit sorry for him, though not nearly as sorry as
he felt for himself if dumbledore believed filch, he would be expelled
for sure.
dumbledore was now muttering strange words under his breath and
tapping mrs. norris with his wand but nothing happened: she
continued to look as though she had been recently stuffed.
". . . i remember something very similar happening in ouagadogou,"
said lockhart, "a series of attacks, the full story's in my
autobiography, i was able to provide the townsfolk with various
amulets, which cleared the matter up at once ......
the photographs of lockhart on the walls were all nodding in
agreement as he talked. one of them had forgotten to remove his hair
net.
at last dumbledore straightened up.
"she's not dead, argus," he said softly.
lockhart stopped abruptly in the middle of counting the number of
murders he had prevented.
"not dead?" choked filch, looking through his fingers at mrs. norris.
"but why's she all - all stiff and frozen?"
"she has been petrified," said dumbledore ("ah! i thought so!" said
lockhart). "but how, i cannot say . . . ."
"ask him!" shrieked filch, turning his blotched and tearstained face to
harry.
"no second year could have done this," said dumbledore firmly. "it
would take dark magic of the most advanced -"
"he did it, he did it!" filch spat, his pouchy face purpling. "you saw
what he wrote on the wall! he found - in my office - he knows i'm a -
119
i'm a -" filch's face worked horribly. "he knows i'm a squib!" he
finished.
142
"i never touched mrs. norris!" harry said loudly, uncomfortably
aware of everyone looking at him, including all the lockharts on the
walls. "and i don't even know what a squib is."
"rubbish!" snarled filch. "he saw my kwikspell letter!"
"if i might speak, headmaster," said snape from the shadows, and
harry's sense of forboding increased; he was sure nothing snape had
to say was going to do him any good.
"potter and his friends may have simply been in the wrong place at the
wrong time," he said, a slight sneer curling his mouth as though he
doubted it. "but we do have a set of suspicious circumstances here.
why was he in the upstairs corridor at all? why wasn't he at the
halloween feast?"
harry, ron and hermione all launched into an explanation about the
deathday party. ". . . there were hundreds of ghosts, theyll tell you we were
there -"
"but why not join the feast afterward?" said snape, his black eyes
glittering in the candlelight. "why go up to that corridor?"
ron and hermione looked at harry.
"because - because -" harry said, his heart thumping very fast;
something told him it would sound very far-fetched if he told them he
had been led there by a bodiless voice no one but he could hear,
"because we were tired and wanted to go to bed," he said.
"without any supper?" said snape, a triumphant smile flickering across
his gaunt face. "i didn't think ghosts provided food fit for living people
at their parties."
"we weren't hungry," said ron loudly as his stomach gave a huge
rumble.
120
snape's nasty smile widened.
*143*
"i suggest, headmaster, that potter is not being entirely truthful," he
said. "it might be a good idea if he were deprived of certain privileges
until he is ready to tell us the whole story. i personally feel he should
be taken off the gryffindor quidditch team until he is ready to be
honest."
"really, severus," said professor mcgonagall sharply, "i see no
reason to stop the boy playing quidditch. this cat wasn't hit over the
head with a broomstick. there is no evidence at all that potter has
done anything wrong."
dumbledore was giving harry a searching look. his twinkling lightblue
gaze made harry feel as though he were being x-rayed.
"innocent until proven guilty, severus," he said firmly.
snape looked furious. so did filch.
"my cat has been petrified!" he shrieked, his eyes popping. "i want to
see some punishment!"
"we will be able to cure her, argus," said dumbledore patiently.
"professer sprout recently managed to procure some mandrakes. as
soon as they have reached their full size, i will have a potion made that
will revive mrs. norris."
"i'll make it," lockhart butted in. "i must have done it a hundred times.
i could whip up a mandrake restorative draught in my sleep -"
"excuse me," said snape icily. "but i believe i am the potions master
at this school."
there was a very awkward pause.
"you may go," dumbledore said to harry, ron, and hermione.
they went, as quickly as they could without actually running. when
they were a floor up from lockhart's office, they turned into
121
*144*
an empty classroom and closed the door quietly behind them. harry
squinted at his friends' darkened faces.
"d'you think i should have told them about that voice i heard?"
"no," said ron, without hesitation. "hearing voices no one else can
hear isn't a good sign, even in the wizarding world."
something in ron's voice made harry ask, "you do believe me, don't
you?"
"'course i do," said ron quickly. "but -you must admit it's weird ......
"i know it's weird," said harry. "the whole thing's weird. what was
that writing on the wall about? the cbamber has been opened...
what's that supposed to mean?"
"you know, it rings a sort of bell," said ron slowly. "i think someone
told me a story about a secret chamber at hogwarts once ... might've
been bill . . . ."
"and what on earth's a squib?" said harry.
to his surprise, ron stifled a snigger.
"well - it's not funny really - but as it's filch, he said. "a squib is
someone who was born into a wizarding family but hasn't got any
magic powers. kind of the opposite of muggle-born wizards, but
squibs are quite unusual. if filch's trying to learn magic from a
kwikspell course, i reckon he must be a squib. it would explain a lot.
like why he hates students so much." ron gave a satisfied smile.
"he's bitter."
a clock chimed somewhere.
"midnight," said harry. "we'd better get to bed before snape comes
along and tries to frame us for something else."

for a few days, the school could talk of little else but the attack on
mrs. norris. filch kept it fresh in everyone's minds by pacing the spot
where she had been attacked, as though he thought the attacker might
come back. harry had seen him scrubbing the message on the wall
with mrs. skower's all-purpose magical mess remover, but to no
effect; the words still gleamed as brightly as ever on the stone. when
filch wasn't guarding the scene of the crime, he was skulking redeyed
through the corridors, lunging out at unsuspecting students and
trying to put them in detention for things like "breathing loudly' and
"looking happy."
ginny weasley seemed very disturbed by mrs. norris's fate.
according to ron, she was a great cat lover.
"but you haven't really got to know mrs. norris," ron told her
bracingly. "honestly, we're much better off without her." ginny's lip
trembled. "stuff like this doesn't often happen at hogwarts," ron
assured her. "they'll catch the maniac who did it and h what was curious had mr. olhivander explained that the phoenix feather in harry's wand had come from the same bird that had supplied the core of lord voldemort's.

harry had never shared this piece of information with anybody. he was very fond of his wand, and as far as he was concerned its relation to voldemort's wand was something it couldn't help - rather as he couldn't help being related to aunt petunia. however, he really hoped that mr. ollivander wasn't about to tell the room about it. he had a funny feeling rita skeeter's quick-quotes quill might just explode with excitement if he did.

mr. ollivander spent much longer examining harry's wand than anyone else's.

eventually, however, he made a fountain of wine shoot out of it, and handed it back to harry, announcing that it was still in perfect condition.

"thank you all," said dumbledore, standing up at the judges' table. "you may go back to your lessons now - or perhaps it would be quicker just to go down to dinner, as they are about to end -"

feeling that at last something had gone right today, harry got up to leave, but the man with the black camera jumped up and cleared his throat.

"photos, dumbledore, photos!" cried bagman excitedly. "all the judges and champions, what do you think, rita?"

"er - yes, let's do those first," said rita skeeter, whose eyes were upon harry again. "and then perhaps some individual shots."

the photographs took a long time. madame maxime cast everyone else into shadow wherever she stood, and the photographer couldn't stand far enough back

to get her into the frame; eventually she had to sit while everyone else stood around her. karkaroff kept twirling his goatee around his finger to give it an extra curl; krum, whom harry would have thought would have been used to this sort of thing, skulked, half-hidden, at the back of the group. the photographer seemed keenest to get fleur at the front, but rita skeeter kept hurrying forward and dragging harry into greater prominence. then she insisted on separate shots of all the champions. at last, they were free to go.

harry went down to dinner. hermione wasn't there - he supposed she was still in the hospital wing having her teeth fixed. he ate alone at the end of the table, then returned to gryffindor tower, thinking of all the extra work on summoning charms that he had to do. up in the dormitory, he came across ron.

"you've had an owl," said ron brusquely the moment he walked in. he was pointing at harry's pillow. the school barn owl was waiting for him there.

"oh - right," said harry.

"and we've got to do our detentions tomorrow night, snape's dungeon," said ron.

he then walked straight out of the room, not looking at harry. for a moment, harry considered going after him - he wasn't sure whether he wanted to talk to him or hit him, both seemed quite appealing - but the lure of sirius's answer was too strong. harry strode over to the barn owl, took the letter off its leg, and unrolled it.

harry - i can't say everything i would like to in a letter, it's too risky in case the owl is intercepted - we need to talk face-to-face. can you ensure that you are alone by the fire in gryffindor tower at one o'clock in the morning on the 22nd ofnovember!

i know better than anyone that you can look after yourself and while you're around dumbledore and moody i don't think anyone will be able to hurt you. however, someone seems to be having a good try. entering you in that tournament would have been very risky, especially right under dumbkdore's nose.

be on the watch, harry. i still want to hear about anything unusual. let me know about the 22nd ofnovember as quickly as you can.

sirius

chapter nineteen - the hungarian horntail

the prospect of talking face-to-face with sirius was all that sustained harry over the next fortnight, the only bright spot on a horizon that had never looked darker.

the shock of finding himself school champion had worn off slightly now, and the fear of what was facing him had started to sink in. the first task was drawing steadily nearer; he felt as though it were crouching ahead of him hike some horrific monster, barring his path. he had never suffered nerves like these; they were way beyond anything he had experienced before a quidditch match, not even his last one against slytherin, which had decided who would win the quidditch cup. harry was finding it hard to think about the future at all; he felt as though his whole life had been heading up to, and would finish with, the first task.

admittedly, he didn't see how sirius was going to make him feel any better about having to perform an unknown piece of difficult and dangerous magic in front of hundreds of people, but the mere sight of a friendly face would be something at the moment. harry wrote back to sirius saying that he would be beside the common room fire at the time sirius had suggested; and he and hermione spent a long time going over plans for forcing any stragglers out of the common room on the night in question. if the worst came to the worst, they were going to drop a bag of dungbombs, but they hoped they wouldn't have to resort to that - filch would skin them alive.

in the meantime, life became even worse for harry within the confines of the castle, for rita skeeter had published her piece about the triwizard tournament, and it had turned out to be not so much a report on the tournament as a highly colored life story of harry. much of the front page had been given over to a picture of harry; the article (continuing on pages two, six, and seven) had been all about harry, the names of the beauxbatons and durmstrang champions (misspelled) had been squashed into the last line of the article, and cedric hadn't been mentioned at all.

the article had appeared ten days ago, and harry still got a sick, burning feeling of shame in his stomach every time he thought about it. rita skeeter had reported him saying an awful lot of things that he couldn't remember ever saying in his life, let alone in that broom cupboard.

i suppose i get my strength from my parents. i know they'd be very proud of me if they could see me now. . . . yes, sometimes at night i still cry about them, i'm not ashamed to admit it. . . . i know nothing will hurt me during the tournament, because they're watching over me. . .

but rita skeeter had gone even further than transforming his "er's" into long, sickly sentences: she had interviewed other people about him too.

harry has at last found love at hogwarts. his close friend, colin creevey, says that harry is rarely seen out of the company of one hermione granger, a stunningly pretty muggle-born girl who, like harry, is one of the top students in the school.

from the moment the article had appeared, harry had had to endure people -- slytherins, mainly -- quoting it at him as he passed and making sneering comments.

"want a hanky, potter, in case you start crying in transfiguration?"

"since when have you been one of the top students in the school, potter? or is this a school you and longbottom have set up together?"

"hey - harry!"

"yeah, that's right!" harry found himself shouting as he wheeled around in the corridor, having had just about enough. "i've just been crying my eyes out over my dead mum, and i'm just off to do a bit more. . .

"no - it was just - you dropped your quill."

it was cho. harry felt the color rising in his face.

"oh - right - sorry," he muttered, taking the quill back.

"er. . . good luck on tuesday," she said. "i really hope you do well."

which left harry feeling extremely stupid.

hermione had come in for her fair share of unpleasantness too, but she hadn't yet started yelling at innocent bystanders; in fact, harry was full of admiration for the way she was handling the situation.

"stunningly pretty? her?" pansy parkinson had shrieked the first time she had come face-to-face with hermione after rita's article had appeared. "what was she judging against - a chipmunk?"

"ignore it," hermione said in a dignified voice, holding her head in the air and stalking past the sniggering slytherin girls as though she couldn't hear them. "just ignore it, harry."

but harry couldn't ignore it. ron hadn't spoken to him at all since he had told him about snape's detentions. harry had half hoped they would make things up during the two hours they were forced to pickle rats' brains in snape's dungeon, but that had been the day rita's article had appeared, which seemed to have confirmed ron's belief that harry was really enjoying all the attention.

hermione was furious with the pair of them; she went from one to the other, trying to force them to talk to each other, but harry was adamant: he would talk to ron again only if ron admitted that harry hadn't put his name in the goblet of fire and

apologized for calling him a liar.

"i didn't start this," harry said stubbornly. "it's his problem."

"you miss him!" hermione said impatiently. "and i know he misses you -"

"miss him?" said harry. "i don't miss him. . .

but this was a downright lie. harry liked hermione very much, but she just wasn't the same as ron. there was much hess laughter and a lot more hanging around in the library when hermione was your best friend. harry still hadn't mastered summoning charms, he seemed to have developed something of a block about them, and hermione insisted that learning the theory would help. they consequently spent a lot of time poring over books during their lunchtimes.

viktor krum was in the library an awful lot too, and harry wondered what he was up to. was he studying, or was he looking for things to help him through the first task? hermione often complained about krum being there - not that he ever bothered them - but because groups of giggling girls often turned up to spy on him from behind bookshelves, and hermione found the noise distracting.

"he's not even good-looking!" she muttered angrily, glaring at krum's sharp profile. "they only like him because he's famed," said hermione. "and also," she added, as harry and ron rolled their eyes, "because i'm starting to think this prince character was a bit dodgy."
both harry and ron shouted her down at once.
"it was a laugh!" said ron, upending a ketchup bottle over his sausages. "just a laugh, hermione, that's all!"
"dangling people upside down by the ankle?" said hermi-one. "who puts their time and energy into making up spells like that?"
"fred and george," said ron, shrugging, "it's their kind of thing. and, er--"
"my dad," said harry. he had only just remembered.
"what?" said ron and hermione together.
"my dad used this spell," said harry. "i -- lupin told me."
'this last part was not true; in fact, harry had seen his father use the spell on snape, but he had never told ron and hermione about that particular
excursion into the pensieve. now, however, a wonderful possibility occurred to him. could the half-blood prince possibly be -- ?
"maybe your dad did use it, harry," said hermione, "but he's not the only one. we've seen a whole bunch of people use it, in case you've forgotten. dangling people in the air. making them float along, asleep, helpless."
harry stared at her. with a sinking feeling, he too remembered the behavior of the death eaters at the quidditch world cup. ron came to his aid.
"that was different," he said robustly. "they were abusing it. harry and his dad were just having a laugh. you don't like the prince, hermione," he added, pointing a sausage at her sternly, "because he's better than you at potions --"
"it's got nothing to do with that!" said hermione, her cheeks reddening. "i just think it's very irresponsible to start performing spells when you don't even know what they're for, and stop talking about 'the prince' as if it's his title, i bet it's just a stupid nickname, and it doesn't seem as though he was a very nice person to me!"
"i don't see where you get that from," said harry heatedly. "if he'd been a budding death eater he wouldn't have been boasting about being 'half-blood,' would he?"
even as he said it, harry remembered that his father had been pure-blood, but he pushed the thought out of his mind; he would worry about that later.
"the death eaters can't all be pure-blood, there aren't enough pure-blood wizards left," said hermione stubbornly. "i expect most of them are half-bloods pretending to be pure. it's only muggle-borns they hate, they'd be quite happy to let you and ron join up."
"there is no way they'd let me be a death eater!" said ron indignantly, a bit of sausage flying off the fork he was now brandishing at hermione and hitting ernie macmillan on the head. "my whole family are blood traitors! that's as bad as muggle-borns to death eaters!"
"and they'd love to have me," said harry sarcastically. "we'd be best pals if they didn't keep trying to do me in."
this made ron laugh; even hermione gave a grudging smile, and a distraction arrived in the shape of ginny.
"hey, harry, i'm supposed to give you this."
it was a scroll of parchment with harry's name written upon it in familiar thin, slanting writing.
"thanks, ginny. . . it's dumbledore's next lesson!" harry told ron and hermione, pulling open the parchment and quickly read-ing its contents.
"monday evening!" he felt suddenly light and happy. "want to join us in hogsmeade, ginny?" he asked.
"i'm going with dean -- might see you there," she replied, waving at them as she left.
filch was standing at the oak front doors as usual, checking off the names of people who had permission to go into hogsmeade. the process took even longer than normal as filch was triple-checking everybody with his secrecy sensor.
"what does it matter if we're smuggling dark stuff out?" demanded ron, eyeing the long thin secrecy sensor with apprehension. "surely you ought to be checking what we bring back in?"
his cheek earned him a few extra jabs with the sensor, and he was still wincing as they stepped out into the wind and sleet.
the walk into hogsmeade was not enjoyable. harry wrapped his scarf over his lower face; the exposed part soon felt both raw and numb. the road to the village was full of students bent double against the bitter wind. more than once harry wondered whether they might not have had a better time in the warm common room, and when they finally reached hogsmeade and saw that zonko's joke shop had been boarded up, harry took it as confirmation that this trip was not destined to be fun. ron pointed, with a
thickly gloved hand, toward honeydukes, which was mercifully open, and harry and hermione staggered in his wake into the crowded shop.
"thank god," shivered ron as they were enveloped by warm, toffee-scented air. "let's stay here all afternoon."
"harry, m'boy!" said a booming voice from behind them.
"oh no," muttered harry. the three of them turned to see professor slughorn, who was wearing an enormous furry hat and an overcoat with matching fur collar, clutching a large bag of crystalized pineapple, and occupying at least a quarter of the shop.
"harry, that's three of my little suppers you've missed now!" said slughorn, poking him genially in the chest. "it won't do, m'boy, i'm determined to have you! miss granger loves them, don't you?"
"yes," said hermione helplessly, "they're really --"
"so why don't you come along, harry?" demanded slughorn.
"well, i've had quidditch practice, professor," said harry, who had indeed been scheduling practices every time slughorn had sent him a little, violet ribbon-adorned invitation. this strategy meant that ron was not left out, and they usually had a laugh with ginny, imagining hermione shut up with mclaggen and zabini.
"well, i certainly expect you to win your first match after all the hard work!" said slughorn. "but a little recreation never hurt any body. now, how about monday night, you can't possibly want to practice in this weather...."
"i can't, professor, i've got -- er -- an appointment with professor dumbledore that evening."
"unlucky again!" cried slughorn dramatically. "ah, well . . . you can't evade me forever, harry!"
and with a regal wave, he waddled out of the shop, taking as little notice of ron as though he had been a display of cockroach clusters.
"i can't believe you've wriggled out of another one," said hermione, shaking her head. "they're not that bad, you know. . . they're even quite fun sometimes. . . ." but then she caught sight of ron's expression. "oh, look -- they've got deluxe sugar quills -- those would last hours!"
glad that hermione had changed the subject, harry showed much more interest in the new extra-large sugar quills than he would normally have done, but ron continued to look moody and merely shrugged when hermione asked him where he wanted to go next.
"let's go to the three broomsticks," said harry. "it'll be warm."
they bundled their scarves back over their faces and left the sweetshop. the bitter wind was like knives on their faces after the sugary warmth of honeydukes. the street was not very busy; nobody was lingering to chat, just hurrying toward their destinations. the exceptions were two men a little ahead of them, standing just outside the three broomsticks. one was very tall and thin; squinting through his rain-washed glasses harry recognized the barman who worked in the other hogsmeade pub, the hog's head. as harry, ron, and hermione drew closer, the barman drew his cloak more tightly around his neck and walked away, leaving the shorter man to fumble with something in his arms. they were barely feet from him when harry realized who the man was.
"mundungus!"
the squat, bandy-legged man with long, straggly, ginger hair jumped and dropped an ancient suitcase, which burst open, releasing what looked like the entire contents of a junk shop window.
"oh, 'ello, 'arry," said mundungus fletcher, with a most unconvincing stab at airiness. "well, don't let me keep ya."
and he began scrabbling on the ground to retrieve the contents of his suitcase with every appearance of a man eager to be gone.
"are you selling this stuff?" asked harry, watching mundungus grab an assortment of grubby-looking objects from the ground.
"oh, well, gotta scrape a living," said mundungus. "gimme that!"
ron had stooped down and picked up something silver.
"hang on," ron said slowly. "this looks familiar --"
"thank you!" said mundungus, snatching the goblet out of ron's hand and stuffing it back into the case. "well, i'll see you all _ ouch!"
harry had pinned mundungus against the wall of the pub by the throat. holding him fast with one hand, he pulled out his wand.
"harry!" squealed hermione.
"you took that from sinus's house," said harry, who was almost nose to nose with mundungus and was breathing in an unpleasant smell of old tobacco and spirits. "that had the black family crest on it."
"i -- no -- what -- ?" spluttered mundungus, who was slowly turning purple.
"what did you do, go back the night he died and strip the place?" snarled harry.
"i -- no -- "
"give it to me!"
"harry, you mustn't!" shrieked hermione, as mundungus started to turn blue.
there was a bang, and harry felt his hands fly off mundungus's throat. gasping and spluttering, mundungus seized his fallen case, then -- crack-- he disapparated.
harry swore at the top of his voice, spinning on the spot to see where mundungus had gone.
"come back, you thieving -- !"
"there's no point, harry." tonks had appeared out of nowhere, her mousy hair wet with sleet.
"mundungus will probably be in london by now. there's no point yelling."
"he's nicked sirius's stuff! nicked it!"
"yes, but still," said tonks, who seemed perfectly untroubled by this piece of information. "you should get out of the cold."
she watched them go through the door of the three broom-sticks. the moment he was inside, harry burst out, "he was nicking sirius's stuff!"
"i know, harry, but please don't shout, people are staring," whispered hermione. "go and sit down, i'll get you a drink."
harry was still fuming when hermione returned to their table a few mi any excuse to get rid of teachers she thinks are too close to dumbledore. please, hagrid, teach us something dull that's bound to come up in our owl."
but hagrid merely yawned widely and cast a one-eyed look of longing towards the vast bed in
the corner.
"lis'en, it's bin a long day an' it's late," he said, patting hermione gently on the shoulder, so that her knees gave way and hit the floor with a thud. "oh - sorry -" he pulled her back up by the
neck of her robes. "look, don' you go worryin' abou' me, i promise yeh i've got really good
stuff planned fer yer lessons now i'm back... now you lot had better get back up to the castle, an'
don' forget ter wipe yer footprints out behind yeh!"
"i dunno if you got through to him," said ron a sho rt while later when, having checked that the
coast was clear, they walked back up to the castle through the thickening snow, leaving no trace
behind them due to the obliteration charm hermione was performing as they went.
"then i'll go back again tomorrow," said hermione determinedly. "i'll plan his lessons for him if i have to. i don't care if she throws out trelawney but she's not getting rid of hagrid!"
chapter twenty-one
the eye of the snake
hermione ploughed her way back to hagrid's cabin through two feet of snow on sunday
morning. harry and ron wanted to go with her, but their mountain of homework had reached an
alarming height again, so they remained grudgingly in the common room, trying to ignore the
gleeful shouts drifting up from the grounds outside, where students were enjoying themselves
skating on the frozen lake, tobogganing and, worst of all, bewitching snowballs to zoom up to
gryffindor tower and rap hard on the windows.
"oy!" bellowed ron, finally losing patience and sticking his head out of the window, "i am a
prefect and if one more snowball hits this window - ouch!"
he withdrew his head sharply, his face covered in snow.
"it's fred and george," he said bitterly, slamming the window behind him. "gits..."
hermione returned from hagrid's just before lunch, shivering slightly, her robes damp to the
knees.
"so?" said ron, looking up when she entered. "got all his lessons planned for him?"
"well, i tried," she said dully, sinking into a chair beside harry. she pulled out her wand and
gave it a complicated little wave so that hot air streamed out of the tip; she then pointed this at
her robes, which began to steam as they dried out. "he wasn't even there when i arrived, i was
knocking for at least half an hour. and then he came stumping out of the forest -"
harry groaned. the forbidden forest was teeming with the kind of creatures most likely to get
hagrid the sack. "what's he keeping in there? did he say?" he asked.
"no," said hermione miserably. "he says he wants them to be a surprise. i tried to explain about
umbridge, but he just doesn't get it. he kept saying nobody in their right mind would rather
study knarls than chimaeras - oh, i don't think he's got a chimaera," she added at the appalled
look on harry and ron's faces, "but that's not for lack of trying, from what he said about how
hard it is to get eggs. i don't know how many times i told him he'd be better off following
grubbly-plank's plan, i honestly don't think he listened to half of what i said. he's in a bit of a
funny mood, you know. he still won't say how he got all those injuries."
hagrid's reappearance at the staff table at breakfast next day was not greeted by enthusiasm from
all students. some, like fred, george and lee, roared with delight and sprinted up the aisle
between the gryffindor and hufflepuff tables to wring hagrid's enormous hand; others, like
parvati and lavender, exchanged gloomy looks and shook their heads. harry knew that many of
them preferred professor grubbly-plank's lessons, and the worst of it was that a very small,
unbiased part of him knew that they had good reason: grubbly-plank's idea of an interesting
class was not one where there was a risk that somebody might have their head ripped off.
it was with a certain amount of apprehension that harry, ron and hermione headed down to
hagrid's on tuesday, heavily muffled against the cold. harry was worried, not only about what
hagrid might have decided to teach them, but also about how the rest of the class, particularly
malfoy and his cronies, would behave if umbridge was watching them.
however, the high inquisitor was nowhere to be seen as they struggled through the snow
towards hagrid, who stood waiting for them on the edge of the forest. he did not present a
reassuring sight; the bruises that had been purple on saturday night were now tinged with green
and yellow and some of his cuts still seemed to be bleeding. harry could not understand this: had
hagrid perhaps been attacked by some creature whose venom prevented the wounds it inflicted
from healing? as though to complete the ominous picture, hagrid was carrying what looked like
half a dead cow over his shoulder.
"we're workin' in here today!" hagrid called happily to the approaching students, jerking his
head back at the dark trees behind him. "bit more sheltered! anyway, they prefer the dark."
"what prefers the dark?" harry heard malfoy say sharply to crabbe and goyle, a trace of panic
in his voice. "what did he say prefers the dark - did you hear?"
harry remembered the only other occasion on which malfoy had entered the forest before now;
he had not been very brave then, either. he smiled to himself; after the quidditch match anything
that caused malfoy discomfort was all right with him.
"ready?" said hagrid cheerfully, looking around at the class. "right, well, i've bin savin' a trip
inter the forest fer yer fifth year. thought we'd go an' see these creatures in their natural habitat.
now, what we're studyin' today is pretty rare, i reckon i'm probably the on'y person in britain
who's managed ter train 'em."
"and you're sure they're trained, are you?" said malfoy, the panic in his voice even more
pronounced. "only it wouldn't be the first time you'd brought wild stuff to class, would it?"
the slytherins murmured agreement and a few gryffindors looked as though they thought
malfoy had a fair point, too.
"course they're trained," said hagrid, scowling and hoisting the dead cow a little higher on his
shoulder.
"so what happened to your face, then?" demanded malfoy.
"mind yer own business!" said hagrid, angrily. "now, if yeh've finished askin' stupid questions,
follow me!"
he turned and strode straight into the forest. nobody seemed much disposed to follow. harry
glanced at ron and hermione, who sighed but nodded, and the three of them set off after hagrid,
leading the rest of the class.
they walked for about ten minutes until they reached a place where the trees stood so closely
together that it was as dark as twilight and there was no snow at all on the ground. with a grunt,
hagrid deposited his half a cow on the ground, stepped back and turned to face his class, most of
whom were creeping from tree to tree towards him, peering around nervously as though
expecting to be set upon at any moment.
"gather roun', gather roun'," hagrid encouraged. "now, they'll be attracted by the smell o' the
meat but i'm goin' ter give 'em a call anyway, 'cause they'll like ter know it's me."
he turned, shook his shaggy head to get the hair out of his face and gave an odd, shrieking cry
that echoed through the dark trees like the call of some monstrous bird. nobody laughed: most of
them looked too scared to make a sound.
hagrid gave the shrieking cry again. a minute passed in which the class continued to peer
nervously over their shoulders and around trees for a first glimpse of whatever it was that was
coming. and then, as hagrid shook his hair back for a third time and expanded his enormous
chest, harry nudged ron and pointed into the black space between two gnarled yew trees.
a pair of blank, white, shining eyes were growing larger through the gloom and a moment later
the dragonish face, neck and then skeletal body of a great, black, winged horse emerged from the
darkness. it surveyed the class for a few seconds, swishing its long black tail, then bowed its
head and began to tear flesh from the dead cow with its pointed fangs.
a great wave of relief broke over harry. here at last was proof that he had not imagined these
creatures, that they were real: hagrid knew about them too. he looked eagerly at ron, but ron
was still staring around into the trees and after a few seconds he whispered, "why doesn't hagrid call again?"
most of the rest of the class were wearing expressions as confused and nervously expectant as
ron's and were still gazing everywhere but at the horse standing feet from them. there were
only two other people who seemed to be able to see them: a stringy slytherin boy standing just
behind goyle was watching the horse eating with an expression of great distaste on his face; and
neville, whose eyes were following the swishing progress of the long black tail.
"oh, an' here comes another one!" said hagrid proudly, as a second black horse appeared out of
the dark trees, folded its leathery wings closer to its body and dipped its head to gorge on the
meat. "now... put yer hands up, who can see 'em?"
immensely pleased to feel that he was at last going to understand the mystery of these horses,
harry raised his hand. hagrid nodded at him.
"yeah... yeah, i knew you'd be able ter, harry," he said seriously. "an' you too, neville, eh? an' -"
"excuse me," said malfoy in a sneering voice, "but what exactly are we supposed to be seeing?"
for an answer, hagrid pointed at the cow carcass on the ground. the whole class stared at it for a
few seconds, then several people gasped and parvati squealed. harry understood why: bits of
flesh stripping themselves away from the bones and vanishing into thin air had to look very odd
indeed.
"what's doing it?" parvati demanded in a terrified voice, retreating behind the nearest tree.
"what's eating it?"
"thestrals," said hagrid proudly and hermioaters... '"
the quick-quotes quill was actually in her hand and halfway to her mouth when the rapturous
expression on her face died.
"but of course," she said, lowering the quill and looking daggers at hermione, "little miss
perfect wouldn't want that story out there, would she?"
"as a matter of fact," said hermione sweetly, "that's exactly what little miss perfect does want."
rita stared at her. so did harry. luna, on the other hand, sang weasley is our king dreamily
under her breath and stirred her drink with a cocktail onion on a stick.
"you want me to report what he says about he-who-must-not-be-named?"rita asked hermione in a hushed voice.
"yes, i do," said hermione. "the true story. all the facts. exactly as harry reports them. he'll
give you all the details, he'll tell you the names of the undiscovered death eaters he saw there,
he'll tell you what voldemort looks like now - oh, get a grip on yourself," she added
contemptuously, throwing a napkin across the table, for, at the sound of voldemort's name, rita
had jumped so badly she had slopped half her glass of firewhisky down herself.
rita blotted the front of her grubby raincoat, still staring at hermione. then she said baldly,
"the prophet wouldn't print it. in case you haven't noticed, nobody believes his cock-and-bull
story. everyone thinks he's delusional. now, if you let me write the story from that angle -"
"we don't need another story about how harry's lost his marbles!" said hermione angrily.
"we've had plenty of those already, thank you! i want him given the opportunity to tell the truth!"
"there's no market for a story like that," said rita coldly.
"you mean the prophet won't print it because fudge won't let them," said hermione irritably.
rita gave hermione a long, hard look. then, leaning forwards across the table towards her, she
said in a businesslike tone, "all right, fudge is leaning on the prophet, but it comes to the same
thing. they won't print a story that shows harry in a good light. nobody wants to read it. it's
against the public mood. this last azkaban breakout has got people quite worried enough.
people just don't want to believe you-know-whos back."
"so the daily prophet exists to tell people what they want to hear, does it?" said hermione
scathingly.
rita sat up straight again, her eyebrows raised, and drained her glass of firewhisky.
"the prophet exists to sell itself, you silly girl," she said coldly.
"my dad thinks it's an awful paper," said luna, chipping into the conversation unexpectedly.
sucking on her cocktail onion, she gazed at rita with her enormous, protuberant, slightly mad
eyes. "he publishes important stories he thinks the public needs to know. he doesn't care about
making money."
rita looked disparagingly at luna.
"i'm guessing your father runs some stupid little village newsletter?" she said. "probably, twenty- five ways to mingle with muggles and the dates of the next bring and fly sale?"
"no," said luna, dipping her onion back into her gillywater, "he's the editor of the quibbler."
rita snorted so loudly that people at a nearby table looked round in alarm.
"'important stories he thinks the public needs to know', eh? " she said witheringly. "i could manure my garden with the contents of that rag."
"well, this is your chance to raise the tone of it a bit, isn't it?" said hermione pleasantly. "luna
says her father's quite happy to take harry's interview. that's who'll be publishing it."
rita stared at them both for a moment, then let out a great whoop of laughter.
"the quibbler!" she said, cackling. "you think people will take him seriously if he's published
in the quibbler!"
"some people won't," said hermione in a level voice. "but the daily prophet's version of the
azkaban breakout had some gaping holes in it. i think a lot of people will be wondering whether
there isn't a better explanation of what happened, and if there's an alternative story available,
even if it is published in a -" she glanced sideways at luna, "in a - well, an unusual magazine - i
think they might be rather keen to read it."
rita didn't say anything for a while, but eyed hermione shrewdly, her head a little to one side.
"all right, let's say for a moment i'll do it," she said abruptly. "what kind of fee am i going to
get?"
"i don't think daddy exactly pays people to write f or the magazine," said luna dreamily. "they
do it because it's an honor and, of course, to see their names in print."
rita skeeter looked as though the taste of stinksap was strong in her mouth again as she rounded
on hermione.
"i'm supposed to do this for free?"
"well, yes," said hermione calmly, taking a sip of her drink. "otherwise, as you very well know,
i will inform the authorities that you are an unregistered animagus. of course, the prophet might
give you rather a lot for an insider's account of life in azkaban."
rita looked as though she would have liked nothing better than to seize the paper umbrella
sticking out of hermione's drink and thrust it up her nose.
"i don't suppose i've got any choice, have i?" said rita, her voice shaking slightly. she opened
her crocodile bag once more, withdrew a piece of parchment, and raised her quick-quotes quill.
"daddy will be pleased," said luna brightly. a muscle twitched in rita's jaw.
"okay, harry?" said hermione, turning to him. "ready to tell the public the truth?"
"i suppose," said harry, watching rita balancing the quick-quotes quill at the ready on the
parchment between them.
"fire away, then, rita," said hermione serenely, fishing a cherry out from the bottom of her
glass.
chapter twenty-six
seen and unforeseen
luna said vaguely that she did not know how soon rita's interview with harry would appear
in the quibbler, that her father was expecting a "'lovely long article on recent sightings of
crumple-horned snorkacks,'"- "and of course, that'll be a very important story, so harrys might
have to wait for the following issue," said luna.
harry had not found it an easy experience to talk about the night when voldemort had returned.
rita had pressed him for every little detail and he had given her everything he could remember,
knowing that this was his one big opportunity to tell the world the truth. he wondered how
people would react to the story. he guessed that it would confirm a lot of people in the view that
he was completely insane, not least because his story would be appearing alongside utter rubbish
about crumple-horned snorkacks. but the breakout of bellatrix lestrange and her fellow death
eaters had given harry a burning desire to dosomething, whether or not it worked...
"can't wait to see what umbridge thinks of you going public," said dean, sounding awestruck at
dinner on monday night. seamus was shoveling down large amounts of chicken and ham pie on
dean's other side, but harry knew he was listening.
"it's the right thing to do, harry," said neville, who was sitting opposite him. he was rather pale, but went on in a low voice, "it must have been... tough... talking about it... was it?"
"yeah," mumbled harry, "but people have got to know what voldemorts capable of, haven't
they?"
"that's right," said neville, nodding, "and his death eaters, too... people should know..."
neville left his sentence hanging and returned to his baked potato. seamus looked up, but when
he caught harrys eye he looked quickly back at his plate again. after a while, dean, seamus and
neville departed for the common room, leaving harry and hermione at the table waiting for
ron, who had not yet had dinner because of quidditch practice.
cho chang walked into the hall with her friend marietta. harry's stomach gave an unpleasant
lurch, but she did not look over at the gryffindor table, and sat down with her back to him.
"oh, i forgot to ask you," said hermione brightly, glancing over at the ravenclaw table, "what
happened on your date with cho? how come you were back so early?"
"er... well, it was..." said harry, pulling a dish of rhubarb crumble towards him and helping
himself to seconds, "a complete fiasco, now you mention it."
and he told her what had happened in madam puddifoot's teashop.
"... so then," he finished several minutes later, as the final bit of crumble disappeared, "she jumps up, right, and says, 'i'll see you around, harry,' an d runs out of the place!" he put down his spoon and looked at hermione. "i mean, what was all that about? what was going on?"
hermione glanced over at the back of cho's head and sighed.
"oh, harry" she said sadly. "well, i'm sorry, but you were a bit tactless."
"me, tactless?" said harry, outraged. "one minute we were getting on fine, next minute she was
telling me that roger davies asked her out and how she used to go and snog cedric in that stupid
teashop - how was i supposed to feel about that?"
"well, you see," said hermione, with the patient air of someone explaining that one plus one
equals two to an over-emotional toddler, "you shouldn't have told her that you wanted to meet
me halfway through your date."
"but, but," spluttered harry, "but - you told me to meet you at twelve and to bring her along, how was i supposed to do that without telling her?"
"you should have told her differently," said hermione, still with that maddeningly patient air.
"you should have said it was really annoying, but i'd made you promise to come along to the
three broomsticks, and you really didn't want to go, you'd much rather spend the whole day
with her, but unfortunately you thought you really ought to meet me and would she please,
please come along with you and hopefully you'd be able to get away more quickly. and it might
have been a good idea to mention how ugly you think i am, too," hermione added as an
afterthought.
"but i don't think you're ugly," said harry, bemused.
hermione laughed.
"harry you're worse than ron... well, no, you're not, " she sighed, as ron himself came
stumping into the hall splattered with mud and looking grumpy. "look - you upset cho when
you said you were going to meet me, so s the entrance to gryffindor tower.
"i only came out because mary told me you were threatening to sleep here."
"i was. i would have done. i never meant to call you mudblood, it just - "
"slipped out?" there was no pity in lily's voice. "it's too late. i've made excuses for you for years. none of my friends can understand why i even talk to you. you and your precious little death eater friends - you see, you don't even deny it! you don't even deny that's what you're all aiming to be! you can't wait to join you-know-who, can you?"
he opened his mouth, but closed it without speaking.
"i can't pretend anymore. you've chosen your way, i've chosen mine."
"no - listen, i didn't mean - "
" - to call me mudblood? but you call everyone of my birth mudblood, severus. why should i be any different?"
he struggled on the verge of speech, but with a contemptuous look she turned and climbed back through the portrait hole...
the corridor dissolved, and the scene took a little longer to reform: harry seemed to fly through shifting shapes and colors until his surroundings solidified again and he stood on a hilltop, forlorn and cold in the darkness, the wind whistling through the branches of a few leafless trees. the adult snape was panting, turning on the spot, his wand gripped tightly in his hand, waiting for something or for someone... his fear infected harry too, even though he knew that he could not be harmed, and he looked over his shoulder, wondering what it was that snape was waiting for -
then a blinding, jagged jet of white light flew through the air. harry thought of lightning, but snape had dropped to his knees and his wand had flown out of his hand.
"don't kill me!"
"that was not my intention."
any sound of dumbledore apparating had been drowned by the sound of the wind in the branches. he stood before snape with his robes whipping around him, and his face was illuminated from below in the light cast by his wand.
"well, severus? what message does lord voldemort have for me?"
"no - no message - i'm here on my own account!"
snape was wringing his hands. he looked a little mad, with his straggling black hair flying around him.
"i - i come with a warning - no, a request - please - "
dumbledore flicked his wand. though leaves and branches still flew through the night air around them, silence fell on the spot where he and snape faced each other.
"what request could a death eater make of me?"
"the - the prophecy...the prediction...trelawney..."
"ah, yes," said dumbledore. "how much did you relay to lord voldemort?"
"everything - everything i heard!" said snape. "that is why - it is for that reason - he thinks it means lily evans!"
"the prophecy did not refer to a woman," said dumbledore. "it spoke of a boy born at the end of july - "
"you know what i mean! he thinks it means her son, he is going to hunt her down - kill them all - "
"if she means so much to you," said dumbledore, "surely lord voldemort will spare her? could you not ask for mercy for the mother, in exchange for the son?"
"i have - i have asked him - "
"you disgust me," said dumbledore, and harry had never heard so much contempt in his voice. snape seemed to shrink a little, "you do not care, then, about the deaths of her husband and child? they can die, as long as you have what you want?"
snape said nothing, but merely looked up at dumbledore.
"hide them all, then," he croaked. "keep her - them - safe. please."
"and what will you give me in return, severus?"
"in - in return?" snape gaped at dumbledore, and harry expected him to protest, but after a long moment he said, "anything."
the hilltop faded, and harry stood in dumbledore's office, and something was making a terrible sound, like a wounded animal. snape was slumped forward in a chair and dumbledore was standing over him, looking grim. after a moment or two, snape raised his face, and he looked like a man who had lived a hundred years of misery since leaving the wild hilltop.
"i thought...you were going...to keep her...safe..."
"she and james put their faith in the wrong person," said dumbledore. "rather like you, severus. weren't you hoping that lord voldemort would spare her?"
snape's breathing was shallow.
"her boy survives," said dumbledore.
with a tiny jerk of the head, snape seemed to flick off an irksome fly.
"her son lives. he has her eyes, precisely her eyes. you remember the shape and color of lily evans's eyes, i am sure?"
"don't!" bellowed snape. "gone...dead..."
"is this remorse, severus?"
"i wish...i wish i were dead..."
"and what use would that be to anyone?" said dumbledore coldly. "if you loved lily evans, if you truly loved her, then your way forward is clear."
snape seemed to peer through a haze of pain, and dumbledore's words appeared to take a long time to reach him.
"what - what do you mean?"
"you know how and why she died. make sure it was not in vain. help me protect lily's son."
"he does not need protection. the dark lord has gone - "
"the dark lord will return, and harry potter will be in terrible danger when he does."
there was a long pause, and slowly snape regained control of himself, mastered his own breathing. at last he said, "very well. very well. but never - never tell, dumbledore! this must be between us! swear it! i cannot bear...especially potter's son...i want your word!"
"my word, severus, that i shall never reveal the best of you?" dumbledore sighed, looking down into snape's ferocious, anguished face. "if you insist..."
the office dissolved but re-formed instantly. snape was pacing up and down in front of dumbledore.
" - mediocre, arrogant as his father, a determined rule-breaker, delighted to find himself famous, attention-seeking and impertinent - "
"you see what you expect to see, severus," said dumbledore, without raising his eyes from a copy of transfiguration today. "other teachers report that the boy is modest, likable, and reasonably talented. personally, i find him an engaging child."
dumbledore turned a page, and said, without looking up, "keep an eye on quirrell, won't you?"
a whirl of color, and now everything darkened, and snape and dumbledore stood a little apart in the entrance hall, while the last stragglers from the yule ball passed them on their way to bed.
"well?" murmured dumbledore.
"karkaroff's mark is becoming darker too. he is panicking, he fears retribution; you know how much help he gave the ministry after the dark lord fell." snape looked sideways at dumbledore's crooked-nosed profile. "karkaroff intends to flee if the mark burns."
"does he?" said dumbledore softly, as fleur delacour and roger davies came giggling in from the grounds. "and are you tempted to join him?"
"no," said snape, his black eyes on fleur's and roger's retreating figures. "i am not such a coward."
"no," agreed dumbledore. "you are a braver man by far than igor karkaroff. you know, i sometimes think we sort too soon..."
he walked away, leaving snape looking stricken...
and now harry stood in the headmaster's office yet again. it was nighttime, and dumbledore sagged sideways in the thronelike chair behind the desk, apparently semiconscious. his right hand dangled over the side, blackened and burned. snape was muttering incantations, pointing his wand at the wrist of the hand, while with his left hand he tipped a goblet full of thick golden potion down dumbledore's throat. after a moment or two, dumbledore's eyelids fluttered and opened.
"why," said snape, without preamble, "why did you put on that ring? it carries a curse, surely you realized that. why even touch it?"
marvolo gaunt's ring lay on the desk before dumbledore. it was cracked; the sword of gryffindor lay beside it.
dumbledore grimaced.
"i...was a fool. sorely tempted..."
"tempted by what?"
dumbledore did not answer.
"it is a miracle you managed to return here!" snape sounded furious. "that ring carried a curse of extraordinary power, to contain it is all we can hope for; i have trapped the curse in one hand for the time being - "
dumbledore raised his blackened, useless hand, and examined it with the expression of one being shown an interesting curio.
"you have done very well, severus. how long do you think i have?"
dumbledore's tone was conversational; he might have been asking for a weather forecast. snape hesitated, and then said, "i cannot tell. maybe a year. there is no halting such a spell forever. it will spread eventually, it is the sort of curse that strengthens over time."
dumbledore smiled. the news that he had less than a year to live seemed a matter of little or no concern to him.
"i am fortunate, extremely fortunate, that i have you, severus."
"if you had only summoned me a little earlier, i might have been able to do more, buy you more time!" said snape furiously. he looked down at the broken ring and the sword. "did you think that breaking the ring would break the curse?"
"something like that...i was delirious, no doubt..." said dumbledore. with an effort he straightened himself in his chair. "well, really, this makes matters much more straightforward."
snape looked utterly perplexed. dumbledore smiled.
"i refer to the plan lord voldemort is revolving around me. his plan to have the poor malfoy boy murder me."
snape sat down in the chair harry had so often occupied, across the desk from dumbledore. harry could tell that he wanted to say more on the subject of dumbledore's cursed hand, but the other held it up in polite refusal to discuss the matter further. scowling, snape said, "the dark lord does not expect draco to succeed. this is merely
punishment for lucius's recent failures. slow torture for draco's parents, while they watch him fail and pay the price."
"in short, the boy has had a death sentence pronounced upon him as surely as i have," said dumbledore. "now, i should have thought the natural successor to the job, once draco fails, is yourself?"
there was a short pause.
"that, i think, is the dark lord's plan."
"lord voldemort foresees a moment in the near future when he will not ne climbed into his four-poster, he imagined how it must feel to have parents still living but unable to recognize you. he often got sympathy from strangers for being an orphan, but as he listened to nevilles snores, he thought that neville deserved it more than he did. lying in the darkness, harry felt a rush of anger and hate toward the people who had tortured mr. and mrs. longbottom. ... he remembered the jeers of the crowd as crouch's son and his companions had been dragged from the court by the dementors. ... he understood how they had felt. . . .

then he remembered the milk-white face of the screaming boy and realized with a jolt that he had died a year later. . . .

it was voldemort, harry thought, staring up at the canopy of his bed in the darkness, it all came back to voldemort. ... he was the one who had torn these families apart, who had ruined all these lives. . . .

ron and hermione were supposed to be studying for their exams, which would finish on the day of the third task, but they were putting most of their efforts into helping harry prepare.

"don't worry about it," hermione said shortly when harry pointed this out to them and said he didn't mind practicing on his own for a while, "at least we'll get top marks in defense against the dark arts. we'd never have found out about all these hexes in class."

"good training for when we're all aurors," said ron excitedly, attempting the impediment curse on a wasp that had buzzed into the room and making it stop dead in midair.

the mood in the castle as they entered june became excited and tense again.

everyone was looking forward to the third task, which would take place a week before the end of term. harry was practicing hexes at every available moment. he felt more confident about this task than either of the others. difficult and dangerous though it would undoubtedly be, moody was right: harry had managed to find his way past monstrous creatures and enchanted barriers before now, and this time he had some notice, some chance to prepare himself for what lay ahead.

tired of walking in on harry, hermione, and ron all over the school. professor mcgonagall had given them permission to use the empty transfiguration classroom at lunchtimes. harry had soon mastered the impediment curse, a spell to slow down and obstruct attackers; the reductor curse, which would enable him to blast solid objects out of his way; and the four-point spell, a useful discovery of hermiones that would make his wand point due north, therefore enabling him to check whether he was going in the right direction within the maze. he was still having trouble with the shield charm, though. this was supposed to cast a temporary, invisible wall around himself that deflected minor curses; hermione managed to shatter it with a well-placed jelly-legs jinx, and harry wobbled around the room for ten minutes afterward before she had looked up the counter- jinx.

"you're still doing really well, though," hermione said encouragingly, looking down her list and crossing off those spells they had already learned. "some of these are bound to come in handy."

"come and look at this," said ron, who was standing by the window. he was staring down onto the grounds. "what's malfoy doing?"

harry and hermione went to see. malfoy, crabbe, and goyle were standing in the shadow of a tree below. crabbe and goyle seemed to be keeping a lookout; both were smirking. malfoy was holding his hand up to his mouth and speaking into it.

"he looks like he's using a walkie-talkie," said harry curiously.

"he can't be," said hermione, "i've told you, those sorts of things don't work around hogwarts. come on, harry," she added briskly, turning away from the window and moving back into the middle of the room, "let's try that shield charm again."

sirius was sending daily owls now. like hermione, he seemed to want to concentrate on getting harry through the last task before they concerned themselves with anything else. he reminded harry in every letter that whatever might be going on outside the walls of hogwarts was not harry's responsibility, nor was it within his power to influence it.

if voldemort is really getting stronger again, he wrote, my priority is to ensure your safety. he cannot hope to lay hands on you while you are under dumbledore's protection, but all the same, take no risks: concentrate on getting through that maze safely, and then we can turn our attention to other matters.

harry's nerves mounted as june the twenty-fourth drew closer, but they were not as bad as those he had felt before the first and second tasks. for one thing, he was confident that, this time, he had done everything in his power to prepare for the task. for another, this was the final hurdle, and however well or badly he did, the tournament would at last be over, which would be an enormous relief.

breakfast was a very noisy affair at the gryffindor table on the morning of the

third task. the post owls appeared, bringing harry a good-luck card from sirius. it was only a piece of parchment, folded over and bearing a muddy paw print on its front, but harry appreciated it all the same. a screech owl arrived for hermione, carrying her morning copy of the daily prophet as usual. she unfolded the paper, glanced at the front page, and spat out a mouthful of pumpkin juice all over it.

"what?" said harry and ron together, staring at her. "nothing," said hermione quickly, trying to shove the paper out of sight, but ron grabbed it. he stared at the headline and said, "no way. not today. that old cow."

"what?" said harry. "rita skeeter again?"

"no," said ron, and just like hermione, he attempted to push the paper out of sight.

"it's about me, isn't it?" said harry.

"no," said ron, in an entirely unconvincing tone. but before harry could demand to see the paper. draco malfoy shouted across the great hall from the slytherin table.

"hey, potter! potter! how's your head? you feeling all right? sure you're not going to go berserk on us?"

malfoy was holding a copy of the daily prophet too. slytherins up and down the table were sniggering, twisting in their seats to see harry's reaction.

"let me see it," harry said to ron. "give it here."

very reluctantly, ron handed over the newspaper. harry turned it over and found himself staring at his own picture, beneath the banner headline: "harry potter "disturbed and dangerous"

the boy who defeated he-who-must-not-be-named is unstable and possibly dangerous, writes rita skeeter, special correspondent. alarming evidence has recently come to light about harry potter's strange behavior, which casts doubts upon his suitability to compete in a demanding competition like the triwizard tournament, or even to attend hogwarts school.

potter, the daily prophet can exclusively reveal, regularly collapses at school, and is often heard to complain of pain in the scar on his forehead (relic of the curse with which you-know-who attempted to kill him). on monday last, midway through a divination lesson, your daily prophet reporter witnessed potter storming from the class, claiming that his scar was hurting too badly to continue studying.

it is possible, say top experts at st. mungo's hospital for magical maladies and injuries, that potters brain was affected by the attack inflicted upon him by you- know-who, and that his insistence that the scar is still hurting is an expression of

his deep-seated confusion.

"he might even be pretending," said one specialist. "this could be a plea for attention."

the daily prophet, however, has unearthed worrying facts about harry potter that albus dumbledore, headmaster of hogwarts, has carefully concealed from the wizarding public.

"potter can speak parseltongue," reveals draco malfoy, a hogwarts fourth year.

"there were a lot of attacks on students a couple of years ago, and most people thought potter was behind them after they saw him lose his temper at a dueling club and set a snake on another boy. it was all hushed up, though. but he's made friends with werewolves and giants too. we think he'd do anything for a bit of power."

parseltongue, the ability to converse with snakes, has long been considered a dark art. indeed, the most famous parselmouth of our times is none other than you- know-who himself. a member of the dark force defense league, who wished to remain unnamed, stated that he would regard any wizard who could speak parseltongue "as worthy of investigation. personally, i would be highly suspicious of anybody who could converse with snakes, as serpents are often used in the worst kinds of dark magic, and are historically associated with evildoers."

similarly, "anyone who seeks out the company of such vicious creatures as werewolves and giants would appear to have a fondness for violence."

albus dumbledore should surely consider whether a boy such as this should be allowed to compete in the triwizard tournament. some fear that potter might resort to the dark arts in his desperation to win the tournament, the third task of which takes place this evening.

"gone off me a bit, hasn't she?" said harry lightly, folding up the paper.

over at the slytherin table, malfoy, crabbe, and goyle were laughing at him, tapping their heads with their fingers, pulling grotesquely mad faces, and waggling their tongues like snakes.

"how did she know your scar hurt in divination?" ron said. "there's no way she was there, there's no way she could've heard -"

"the window was open," said harry. "i opened it to breathe."

"you were at the top of north tower!" hermione said. "your voice couldn't have carried all the way down to the grounds!"

"well, you're the one who's supposed to be researching magical methods of bugging!" said harry. "you tell me how she did it!"

"i've been trying!" said hermione. "but i... but. . ."

an odd, dreamy expression suddenly came over hermione's face. she slowly raised a hand and ran her fingers through her hair.

"are you all right?" said ron, fd and strong; white-hot anger leapt
inside him; dumbledore knew nothing about his feelings.
"you see, dumbledore?" said phineas nigellus slyly "never try to understand the students. they
hate it. they would much rather be tragically misunderstood, wallow in self-pity, stew in their
own -"
"that's enough, phineas," said dumbledore.
harry turned his back on dumbledore and stared determinedly out of the window. he could see
the quidditch stadium in the distance. sirius had appeared there once, disguised as the shaggy
black dog, so he could watch harry play... he had probably come to see whether harry was as
good as james had been... harry had never asked him...
"there is no shame in what you are feeling, harry," said dumbledore's voice. "on the contrary... the fact that you can feel pain like this is your greatest strength."
harry felt the white-hot anger lick his insides, blazing in the terrible emptiness, filling him with
the desire to hurt dumbledore for his calmness and his empty words.
"my greatest strength, is it?" said harry, his voice shaking as he stared out at the quidditch
stadium, no longer seeing it. "you haven't got a clue... you don't know..."
"what don't i know?" asked dumbledore calmly.
it was too much. harry turned around, shaking with rage.
"i don't want to talk about how i feel, all right?"
"harry, suffering like this proves you are still a man! this pain is part of being human"
"then - i - don't - want - to - be - human!" harry roared, and he seized the delicate
silver instrument from the spindlelegged table beside him and flung it across the room; it
shattered into a hundred tiny pieces against the wall. several of the pictures let out yells of anger
and fright, and the portrait of armando dippet said, "really!"
"i don't care!" harry yelled at them, snatching up a lunascope and throwing it into the
fireplace. "i've had enough, i've seen enough, i want out, i want it to end,
i don't care any more"
he seized the table on which the silver instrument had stood and threw that, too. it broke apart on
the floor and the legs rolled in different directions.
"you do care," said dumbledore. he had not flinched or made a single move to stop harry
demolishing his office. his expression was calm, almost detached. "you care so much you feel as though you will bleed to death with the pain of it."
"i - don't!" harry screamed, so loudly that he felt his throat might tear, and for a second he
wanted to rush at dumbledore and break him, too; shatter that calm old face, shake him, hurt
him, make him feel some tiny part of the horror inside himself.
"oh, yes, you do," said dumbledore, still more calmly. "you have now lost your mother, your
father, and the closest thing to a parent you have ever known. of course you care."
"you don't know how i feel!" harry roared. "you - standing there - you"
but words were no longer enough, smashing things was no more help; he wanted to run, he
wanted to keep running and never look back, he wanted to be somewhere he could not see the
clear blue eyes staring at him, that hatefully calm old face. he turned on his heel and ran to the
door, seized the doorknob again and wrenched at it.
but the door would not open. harry turned back to dumbledore. "let me out," he said. he was
shaking from head to foot.
"no," said dumbledore, simply. for a few seconds they stared at each other.
"let me out," harry said again.
"no," dumbledore repeated.
"if you don't - if you keep me in here - if you don 't let me"
"by all means continue destroying my possessions," said dumbledore serenely. "i daresay i have
too many."
he walked around his desk and sat down. behind it, watching harry.
"let me out," harry said yet again, in a voice that was cold and almost as calm as
dumbledore's.
"not until i have had my say," said dumbledore.
"do you - do you think i want to - do you think i give a - i don't care what you've
got to say!" harry roared. "i don't want to hear anything you've got to say!"
"you will," said dumbledore steadily. "because you are not nearly as angry with me as you
ought to be. if you are to attack me, as i know you are close to doing, i would like to have
thoroughly earned it."
"what are you talking -?"
"it is my fault that sirius died," said dumbledore clearly. "or should i say, almost entirely my
fault - i will not be so arrogant as to claim responsibility for the whole. sirius was a brave, clever
and energetic man, and such men are not usually content to sit at home in hiding while they
believe others to be in danger. nevertheless, you should never have believed for an instant that
there was any necessity for you to go to the department of mysteries tonight. if i had been open
with you, harry, as i should have been, you would have known a long time ago that voldemort
might try and lure you to the department of mysteries, and you would never have been tricked
into going there tonight. and sirius would not have had to come after you. that blame lies with
me, and with me alone."
harry was still standing with his hand on the doorknob but was unaware of it. he was gazing at
dumbledore, hardly breathing, listening yet barely understanding what he was hearing.
"please sit down," said dumbledore. it was not an order, it was a request.
harry hesitated, then walked slowly across the room now littered with silver cogs and fragments
of wood, and took the seat facing dumbledore's desk.
"am i to understand," said phineas nigellus slowly from harry's left, "that my great-great-grandson - the last of the blacks - is dead?"
"yes, phineas," said dumbledore.
"i don't believe it," said phineas brusquely.
harry turned his head in time to see phineas marching out of his portrait and knew that he had
gone to visit his other painting in grimmauld place. he would walk, perhaps, from portrait to
portrait, calling for sirius through the house...
"harry, i owe you an explanation," said dumbledore. "an explanation of an old man's mistakes.
for i see now that what i have done, and not done, with regard to you, bears all the hallmarks of
the failings of age. youth cannot know how age thinks and feels. but old men are guilty if they
forget what it was to be young... and i seem to have forgotten, lately..."
the sun was rising properly now; there was a rim of dazzling orange visible over the mountains
and the sky above it was colorless and bright. the light fell upon dumbledore, upon the silver
of his eyebrows and beard, upon the lines gouged deeply into his face.
"i guessed, fifteen years ago," said dumbledore, "when i saw the scar on your forehead, what it
might mean. i guessed that it might be the sign of a connection forged between you and
voldemort."
"you've told me this before, professor," said harry bluntly. he did not care about being rude. he
did not care about anything very much any more.
"yes," said dumbledore apologetically. "yes, but you see - it is necessary to start with your scar. for it became apparent, shortly after you rejoined the magical world, that i was correct, and that your scar was giving you warnings when voldemort was close to you, or else feeling powerful emotion."
"i know," said harry wearily.
"and this ability of yours - to detect voldemort's presence, even when he is disguised, and to
know what he is feeling when his emotions are roused - has become more and more pronounced
since voldemort returned to his own body and his full powers."
harry did not bother to nod. he knew all of this already.
"more recently" said dumbledore, "i became concerned that voldemort might realize that this
connection between you exists. sure enough, there came a time when you entered so far into his
mind and thoughts that he sensed your presence. i am speaking, of course, of the night when you
witnessed the attack on mr. weasley"
"yeah, snape told me," harry muttered.
"professor snape, harry" dumbledore corrected him quietly. "but did you not wonder why it was not i who explained this to you? why i did not teach you occlumency? why i had not so much as looked at you for months?"
harry looked up. he could see now that dumbledore looked sad and tired.
"yeah," harry mumbled. "yeah, i wondered."
"you see," dumbledore continued, "i believed it could not be long before voldemort attempted
to force his way into your mind, to manipulate and misdirect your thoughts, and i was not eager
to give him more incentives to do so. i was sure that if he realized that our relationship was - or
had ever been - closer than that of headmaster and pupil, he would seize his chance to use you as
a means to spy on me. i feared the uses to which he would put you, the possibility that he might
try and possess you. harry, i believe i was right to think that voldemort would have made use of
you in such a way. on those rare occasions when we had close contact, i thought i saw a shadow
of him stir behind your eyes..."
harry remembered the feeling that a dormant snake had risen in him, ready to strike, in those
moments when he and dumbledore had made eye-contact.
"voldemort's aim in possessing you, as he demonstrated tonight, would not have been my
destruction. it would have been yours. he hoped, when he possessed you briefly a short while
ago, that i would sacrifice you in the hope of killing him. so you see, i have been trying, in
distancing myself from you, to protect you, harry. an old man's mistake..."
he sighed deeply. harry was letting the words wash over him. he would have been so interested
to know all this a few months ago, but now it was meaningless compared to the gaping chasm
inside him that was the loss of sirius; none of it mattered...
"sirius told me you felt voldemort awake inside you the very night that you had the vision of
arthur weasley's attack. i knew at once that my worst fears were correct: voldemort had
realized he could use you. in an attempt to arm you against voldemort's assaults on your mind, i
arranged occlumency lessons with professor snape."
he paused. harry watched the sunlight, which was sliding slowly across tay to force someone to do what you want, and that's the imperius curse, which is illegal --"
"yeah, i know that, thanks," said harry, not looking up from the book. "that's why i'm looking for something different. dumbledorf says veritaserum won't do it, but there might be something else, a potion or a spell. . . ."
"you're going about it the wrong way," said hermione. "only you can get the memory, dumbledore says. that must mean you can persuade slughorn where other people can't. it's not a question of slipping him a potion, anyone could do that --"
"how do you spell 'belligerent'?" said ron, shaking his quill very hard while staring at his parchment. "it can't be b -- u -- m --"
"no, it isn't," said hermione, pulling ron's essay toward her. "and 'augury' doesn't begin o -- r -- g either. what kind of quill are you using?"
"it's one of fred and george's spell-check ones, but i think the charm must be wearing off."
"yes, it must," said hermione, pointing at the title of his essay, "because we were asked how we'd deal with dementors, not 'dug-bogs', and i don't remember you changing your name to 'roonil wazlib' either."
"ah no!" said ron, staring horror-struck at the parchment. "don't say i'll have to write the whole thing out again!"
"it's okay, we can fix it," said hermione, pulling the essay toward her and taking out her wand.
"i love you, hermione," said ron, sinking back in his chair, rub-bing his eyes wearily. hermione turned faintly pink, but merely said, "don't let lavender hear you saying that."
"1 won't," said ron into his hands. "or maybe i will, then she'll ditch me."
"why don't you ditch her if you want to finish it?" asked harry.
"you haven't ever chucked anyone, have you?" said ron. "you and cho just --"
"sort of fell apart, yeah," said harry.
"wish that would happen with me and lavender," said ron gloomily, watching hermione silently tapping each of his mis-spelled words with the end of her wand, so that they corrected themselves on the page. "but the more i hint i want to finish it, the tighter she holds on. it's like going out with the giant squid."
"there," said hermione, some twenty minutes later, handing back ron's essay.
"thanks a million," said ron. "can i borrow your quill for the conclusion?" harry, who had found nothing useful in the half-blood
prince's notes so far, looked around; the three of them were now the only ones left in the common room, seamus having just gone up to bed cursing snape and his essay. the only sounds were the crackling of the fire and ron scratching out one last paragraph on dementors using hermione's quill. harry had just closed the half-blood prince's book, yawning, when --
crack!
hermione let out a little shriek; ron spilled ink all over his freshly completed essay, and harry said, "kreacher!"
the house-elf bowed low and addressed his own gnarled toes. "master said he wanted regular reports on what the malfoy boy is doing, so kreacher has come to give--"
crack!
dobby appeared alongside kreacher, his tea-cozy hat askew. "dobby has been helping too, harry potter!" he squeaked, cast-ing kreacher a resentful look. "and kreacher ought to tell dobby when he is coming to see harry potter so they can make their re-ports together!"
"what is this?" asked hermione, still looking shocked by these sudden appearances. "what's going on, harry?" harry hesitated before answering, because he had not told her-mione about setting kreacher and dobby to tail malfoy; house-elves were always such a touchy subject with her.
"well. . . they've been following malfoy for me," he said.
"night and day," croaked kreacher.
"dobby has not slept for a week, harry potter!" said dobby proudly, swaying where he stood. hermione looked indignant.
"you haven't slept, dobby? but surely, harry, you didn't tell him not to --"
"no, of course i didn't," said harry quickly. "dobby, you can sleep, all right? but has either of you found out anything?" he has-tened to ask, before hermione could intervene again.
"master malfoy moves with a nobility that befits his pure blood," croaked kreacher at once. "his features recall the fine bones of my mistress and his manners are those of--"
"draco malfoy is a bad boy!" squeaked dobby angrily. "a bad boy who -- who --" he shuddered from the tassel of his tea cozy to the toes of his socks and then ran at the fire, as though about to dive into it. harry, to whom this was not entirely unexpected, caught him around the middle and held him fast. for a few seconds dobby struggled, then went limp.
"thank you, harry potter," he panted. "dobby still finds it dif-ficult to speak ill of his old masters." harry released him; dobby straightened his tea
cozy and said defiantly to kreacher, "but kreacher should know that draco malfoy is not a good master to a house-elf!"
"yeah, we don't need to hear about you being in love with malfoy," harry told kreacher. "let's fast forward to where he's actually been going."
kreacher bowed again, looking furious, and then said, "master malfoy eats in the great hall, he sleeps in a dormitory in the dun-geons, he attends his classes in a variety of--"
"dobby, you tell me," said harry, cutting across kreacher. "has he been going anywhere he shouldn't have?"
"harry potter, sir," squeaked dobby, his great orblike eyes shining in the firelight, "the malfoy boy is breaking no rules that dobby can discover, but he is still keen to avoid detection. he has been making regular visits to the seventh floor with a variety of other students, who keep watch for him while he enters --"
"the room of requirement!" said harry, smacking himself hard on the forehead with advanced potion-making. hermione and ron stared at him. "that's where he's been sneaking off to! that's where he's doing... whatever he's doing! and i bet that's why he's been disappearing off the map -- come to think of it, i've never seen the room of requirement on there!"
"maybe the marauders never knew the room was there," said ron.
"i think it'll be part of the magic of the room," said hermione. "if you need it to be unplottable, it will be."
"dobby, have you managed to get in to have a look at what malfoy's doing?" said harry eagerly.
"no, harry potter, that is impossible," said dobby.
"no, it's not," said harry at once. "malfoy got into our head-quarters there last year, so i'll be able to get in and spy on him, no problem."
"but i don't think you will, harry," said hermione slowly. "mal-foy already knew exactly how we were using the room, didn't he, because that stupid marietta had blabbed. he needed the room to become the headquarters of the d.a., so it did. but you don't know what the room becomes when malfoy goes in there, so you don't know what to ask it to transform into."
"there'll be a way around that," said harry dismissively. "you've done brilliantly, dobby."
"kreachers done well too," said hermione kindly; but far from looking grateful, kreacher averted his huge, bloodshot eyes and croaked at the ceiling, "the mudblood is speaking to kreacher, kreacher will pretend he cannot hear --"
"get out of it," harry snapped at him, and kreacher made one last deep bow and disapparated. "you'd better go and get some sleep too, dobby."
"thank you, harry potter, sir!" squeaked dobby happily, and he too vanished.
"how good is this?" said harry enthusiastically, turning to ron and hermione the moment the room was elf-free again. "we know where malfoy's going! we've got him cornered now!"
"yeah, it's great," said ron glumly, who was attempting to mop up the sodden mass of ink chat had recently been an almost com-pleted essay. hermione pulled it toward her and began siphoning the ink off with her wand.
"but what's all this about him going up there with a variety of students'?" said hermione. "how many people are in on it? you wouldn't think he'd trust lots of them to know what he's do-ing---"
"yeah, that is weird," said harry, frowning. "i heard him telling crabbe it wasn't crabbe's business what he was doing... so what's he telling all these... all these..." harry's voice tailed away; he was staring at the fire. "god, i've been stupid," he said quietly. "its obvious, isn't it? there was a great vat of it down in the dungeon. . . . he could've nicked some any time during that lesson. . . ."
"nicked what?" said ron.
"polyjuice potion. he stole some of the polyjuice potion slug-horn showed us in our first potions lesson... there aren't a whole variety of students standing guard for malfoy... it's just crabbe and goyle as usual. ...yeah, it all fits!" said harry, jumping up and starting to pace in front of the fire. "they're stupid enough to do what they're told even if he won't tell them what he's up to, but he doesn't want them to be seen lurking around outside the room of requirement, so he's got them taking polyjuice to make them look like other people... those two girls i saw him with when he missed quidditch -- ha! crabbe and goyle!"
"do you mean to say," said hermione in a hushed voice, "that that little girl whose scales i repaired -- ?"
"yeah, of course!" said harry loudly, staring at her. "of course! malfoy must've been inside the room at the time, so she -- what am i talking about? -- he dropped the scales to tell malfoy not to corne out, because there was someone there! and there was that girl who dropped the toadspawn too! we've been walking past him all the time and not realizing it!"
"he's got crabbe and goyle transforming into girls?" guffawed ron. "blimey... no wonder they don't look too happy these days. i'm surprised they don't tell him to stuff it."
"well, they wouldn't, would they, if he's shown them his dark mark?" said harry.
"hmmm... the dark mark we don't know exists," said hermi-one skeptically, rolling up ron's dried essay before it could come to any more harm and handing it to him.
"we'll see" said harry confidently.
"yes, we will," hermione said, getting to her feet and stretching. "but, harry, before you get all excited, i still don't think you'll be able to get into the  her, producing more hats and scarves.
knowing they were doing something to resist umbridge and the ministry, and that he was a key
part of the rebellion, gave harry a feeling of immense satisfaction. he kept reliving saturdays
meeting in his mind: all those people, coming to him to learn defense against the dark arts...
and the looks on their faces as they had heard some of the things he had done... and cho praising
his performance in the triwizard tournament - the knowledge that all those people did not think him a lying weirdo, but someone to be admired, buoyed him up so much that he was still cheerful on monday morning, despite the imminent prospect of all his least favorite classes.
he and ron headed downstairs from their dormitory, discussing angelinas idea that they were to
work on a new move called the sloth grip roll during that night's quidditch practice, and not
until they were halfway across the sunlit common room did they notice the addition to the room
that had already attracted the attention of a small group of people.
a large sign had been affixed to the gryffindor noticeboard; so large it covered everything else
on it - the lists of secondhand spellbooks for sale, the regular reminders of school rules from
argus filch, the quidditch team training timetable, the offers to barter certain chocolate frog
cards for others, the weasleys' latest advertisement for testers, the dates of the hogsmeade
weekends and the lost and found notices. the new sign was printed in large black letters and
there was a highly official-looking seal at the bottom beside a neat and curly signature.
by order of the high inquisitor of hogwarts
all student organizations, societies, teams, groups and clubs are henceforth disbanded.
an organization, society, team, group or club is hereby defined as a regular meeting of three or
more students.
permission to re-form may be sought from the high inquisitor (professor umbridge).
no student organization, society, team, group or club may exist without the knowledge and
approval of the high inquisitor.
any student found to have formed, or to belong to, an organization, society, team, group or club
that has not been approved by the high inquisitor will be expelled.
the above is in accordance with educational decree number twenty-four.
signed: dolores jane umbridge, high inquisitor
harry and ron read the notice over the heads of some anxious-looking second-years.
"does this mean they're going to shut down the gobstones club?" one of them asked his friend.
"i reckon you'll be okay with gobstones," ron said darkly, making the second-year jump. "i don't think we're going to be as lucky, though, do you?" he asked harry as the second-years hurried away.
harry was reading the notice through again. the happiness that had filled him since saturday
was gone. his insides were pulsing with rage.
"this isn't a coincidence," he said, his hands forming fists. "she knows."
"she can't," said ron at once.
"there were people listening in that pub. and let's face it, we don't know how many of the people who turned up we can trust... any of them could have run off and told umbridge..."
and he had thought they believed him, thought they even admired him...
"zacharias smith!" said ron at once, punching a fist into his hand. "or - i thought that michael
corner had a really shifty look, too -"
"i wonder if hermione's seen this yet?" harry said, looking round at the door to the girls'
dormitories.
"let's go and tell her," said ron. he bounded forwards, pulled open the door and set off up the
spiral staircase.
he was on the sixth stair when there was a loud, wailing, klaxon-like sound and the steps melted
together to make a long, smooth stone slid. there was a brief moment when ron tried to keep running, arms working madly like windmills, then he toppled over backwards and shot down the newly created slide, coming to rest on his back at harry's feet.
"er - i don't think we're allowed in the girls' dormitories," said harry, pulling ron to his feet and trying not to laugh.
two fourth-year girls came zooming gleefully down the stone slide.
"oooh, who tried to get upstairs?" they giggled happily, leaping to their feet and ogling harry
and ron.
"me," said ron, who was still rather disheveled. " i didn't realize that would happen. it's not
fair!" he added to harry, as the girls headed off for the portrait hole, still giggling madly. "hermione's allowed in our dormitory, how come we're not allowed -?"
"well, it's an old-fashioned rule," said hermione, who had just slid neatly on to a rug in front of
them and was now getting to her feet, "but it says in hogwarts a history, that the founders
thought boys were less trustworthy than girls. anyway, why were you trying to get in there?"
"to see you - look at this!" said ron, dragging her over to the noticeboard.
hermione's eyes slid rapidly down the notice. her expression became stony.
"someone must have blabbed to her!" ron said angrily.
"they can't have done," said hermione in a low voice.
"you're so naive," said ron, "you think just because you're all honorable and trustworthy -"
"no, they can't have done, because i put a jinx on that piece of parchment we all signed," said
hermione grimly. "believe me, if anyone's run off and told umbridge, we'll know exactly who
they are and they will really regret it."
"what'll happen to them?" said ron eagerly.
"well, put it this way" said hermione, "it'll make eloise midgeon's acne look like a couple of
cute freckles. come on, let's get down to breakfast and see what the others think... i wonder
whether this has been put up in all the houses?"
it was immediately apparent on entering the great hall that umbridge's sign had not only
appeared in gryffindor tower. there was a peculiar intensity about the chatter and an extra
measure of movement in the hall as people scurried up and down their tables conferring on what
they had read. harry, ron and hermione had barely taken their seats when neville, dean, fred,
george and ginny descended upon them.
"did you see it?"
"d'you reckon she knows?"
"what are we going to do?"
they were all looking at harry. he glanced around to make sure there were no teachers near
them.
"we're going to do it anyway of course," he said quietly.
"knew you'd say that"' said george, beaming and thumping harry on the arm.
"the prefects as well?" said fred, looking quizzically at ron and hermione.
"of course," said hermione coolly.
"here come ernie and hannah abbott," said ron, looking over his shoulder. "and those
ravenclaw blokes and smith... and no one looks very spotty."
hermione looked alarmed.
"nevermind spots, the idiots can't come over here now, it'll look really suspicious - sit down!"
she mouthed to ernie and hannah, gesturing frantically to them to rejoin the hufflepuff table.
"later! we'll - talk - to - you - later!"
"i'll tell michael," said ginny impatiently, swinging herself off her bench, "the fool, honestly..."
she hurried off towards the ravenclaw table; harry watched her go. cho was sitting not far
away, talking to the curly-haired friend she had brought along to the hog's head. would
umbridge's notice scare her off meeting them again?
but the full repercussions of the sign were not felt until they were leaving the great hall for
history of magic.
"harry! ron!"
it was angelina and she was hurrying towards them looking perfectly desperate.
"it's okay," said harry quietly, when she was near enough to hear him. "we're still going to -"
"you realize she's including quidditch in this?" angelina said over him. "we have to go and ask
permission to re-form the gryffindor team!"
"what?" said harry.
"no way," said ron, appalled.
"you read the sign, it mentions teams too! so listen, harry... i am saying this for the last time...
please, please don't lose your temper with umbridge again or she might not let us play any
more!"
"okay,okay," said harry, for angelina looked as though she was on the verge of tears. "don't
worry, i'll behave myself..."
"bet umbridge is in history of magic," said ron grimly, as they set off for binns's lesson. "she
hasn't inspected binns yet... bet you anything she's there..."
but he was wrong; the only teacher present when they entered was professor binns, floating an
inch or so above his chair as usual and preparing to continue his monotonous drone on giant
wars. harry did not even attempt to follow what he was saying today; he doodled idly on his
parchment ignoring hermione's frequent glares and nudges, until a particularly painful poke in
the ribs made him look up angrily.
"what?"
she pointed at the window. harry looked round. hedwig was perched on the narrow window
ledge, gazing through the thick glass at him, a letter tied to her leg. harry could not understand
it; they had just had breakfast, why on earth hadn't she delivered the letter then, as usual? many
of his classmates were pointing out hedwig to each other, too.
"oh, i've always loved that owl, she's so beautiful," harry heard lavender sigh to parvati.
he glanced round at professor binns who continued to read his notes, serenely unaware that the
class's attention was even less focused upon him than usual. harry slipped quietly off his chair,
crouched down and hurried along the row to the window, where he slid the catch and opened it
very slowly.
he had expected hedwig to hold out her leg so that he could remove the letter and then fly off to
the owlery but the moment the window was open wide enough she hopped inside, hooting
dolefully. he closed the window with an anxious glance at professor binns, crouched low again
and sped back to his seat with hedwig on his shoulder. he regained his seat, transferred hedwig
to his lap and made to remove the letter tied to her leg.
only then did he realize that hedwig's feathers were oddly ruffled; some were bent the wrong
way, and she was holding one of her wings at an odd angle.
"she's hurt!" harry whispered, bending his head low over her. hermione and ron leaned in
closer; hermio as ron said, you couldn't have everything in life. 

and suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, neville's toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays ("i always hope they'll forget to give us these," said fred weasley sadly); hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the hogwarts express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating bettie bott's every flavor beans as they sped past muggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at king's cross station. 

it took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. a wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didn't attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the muggles. 

"you must come and stay this summer," said ron, "both of you -- i'll send you an owl." 

"thanks," said harry, "i'll need something to look forward to." people jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the muggle world. some of them called: "bye, harry!" 

"see you, potter!" 

"still famous," said ron, grinning at him. 

"not where i'm going, i promise you," said harry. 

he, ron, and hermione passed through the gateway together. "there he is, mom, there he is, look!" 

it was ginny weasley, ron's younger sister, but she wasn't pointing at ron. 

"harry potter!" she squealed. "look, mom! i can see "be quiet, ginny, and it's rude to point." 

mrs. weasley smiled down at them. 

"busy year?" she said. 

"very," said harry. "thanks for the fudge and the sweater, mrs. weasley." 

"oh, it was nothing, dear." 

"ready, are you?" 

it was uncle vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people. behind him stood aunt petunia and dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of harry. 

"you must be harry's family!" said mrs. weasley. 

"in a manner of speaking," said uncle vernon. "hurry up, boy, we haven't got all day." he walked away. 

harry hung back for a last word with ron and hermione. 

"see you over the summer, then." 

"hope you have -- er -- a good holiday," said hermione, looking uncertainly after uncle vernon, shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant. 

"oh, i will," said harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over his face. "they don't know we're not allowed to use magic at home. i'm going to have a lot of fun with dudley this summer...."

c h a p t e o n e
the worst birthday
not for the first time, an argument had broken out over breakfast at
number four, privet drive. mr. vernon dursley had been woken in
the early hours of the morning by a loud, hooting noise from his
nephew harry's room.
"third time this week!" he roared across the table. "if you can't
control that owl, it'll have to go!"
harry tried, yet again, to explain.
"she's bored," he said. "she's used to flying around outside. if i could
just let her out at night -"
"do i look stupid?" snarled uncle vernon, a bit of fried egg dangling
from his bushy mustache. "i know what'll happen if that owl's let
out."
he exchanged dark looks with his wife, petunia.
harry tried to argue back but his words were drowned by a long,
loud belch from the dursleys' son, dudley.
2
"i want more bacon."
"there's more in the frying pan, sweetums," said aunt petunia,
turning misty eyes on her massive son. "we must build you up while
we've got the chance .... i don't like the sound of that school food
......
"nonsense, petunia, i never went hungry when i was at smeltings,"
said uncle vernon heartily. "dudley gets enough, don't you, son?"
dudley, who was so large his bottom drooped over either side of the
kitchen chair, grinned and turned to harry.
"pass the frying pan."
"you've forgotten the magic word," said harry irritably.
the effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was
incredible: dudley gasped and fell off his chair with a crash that
shook the whole kitchen; mrs. dursley gave a small scream and
clapped her hands to her mouth; mr. dursley jumped to his feet,
veins throbbing in his temples.
"i meant `please'!" said harry quickly. "i didn't mean -"
"what have i told you," thundered his uncle, spraying spit
over the table, "about saying the `m' word in our
house?"
"but i -"
"how dare you threaten dudley!" roared uncle
vernon, pounding the table with his fist.
"i just -"
"i warned you! i will not tolerate mention of
your abnormality under this roof!"
harry stared from his purple-faced uncle to his pale aunt, who was
trying to heave dudley to his feet.
3
"all right," said harry, "all right. . . "
uncle vernon sat back down, breathing like a winded rhinoceros and
watching harry closely out of the corners of his small, sharp eyes.
ever since harry had come home for the summer holidays, uncle
vernon had been treating him like a bomb that might go off at any
moment, because harry potter wasn't a normal boy. as a matter of
fact, he was as not normal as it is possible to be.
harry potter was a wizard - a wizard fresh from his first year at
hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. and if the dursleys
were unhappy to have him back for the holidays, it was nothing to how
harry felt.
he missed hogwarts so much it was like having a constant
stomachache. he missed the castle, with its secret passageways and
ghosts, his classes (though perhaps not snape, the potions master), the
mail arriving by owl, eating banquets in the great hall, sleeping in his
four-poster bed in the tower dormitory, visiting the gamekeeper,
hagrid, in his cabin next to the forbidden forest in the grounds, and,
especially, quidditch, the most popular sport in the wizarding world
(six tall goal posts, four flying balls, and fourteen players on
broomsticks).
all harry's spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron, and top-of-the-line
nimbus two thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard
under the stairs by uncle vernon the instant harry had come home.
what did the dursleys care if harry lost his place on the house
quidditch team because he hadn't practiced all summer? what was it
to the dursleys if harry went back to school without any of his
homework done? the dursleys were what wizards called muggles
(not a drop of magical blood in their veins),
and as far as they were concerned, having a wizard in the family was
a matter of deepest shame. uncle vernon had even padlocked
harry's owl, hedwig, inside her cage, to stop her from carrying
messages to anyone in the wizarding world.
harry looked nothing like the rest of the family. uncle vernon was
large and neckless, with an enormous black mustache; aunt petunia
4
was horse-faced and bony; dudley was blond, pink, and porky. harry,
on the other hand, was small and skinny, with brilliant green eyes and
jet-black hair that was always untidy. he wore round glasses, and on
his forehead was a thin, lightning-shaped scar.
it was this scar that made harry so particularly unusual, even for a
wizard. this scar was the only hint of harry's very mysterious past, of
the reason he had been left on the dursleys' doorstep eleven years
before.
at the age of one year old, harry had somehow survived a curse from
the greatest dark sorcerer of all time, lord voldemort, whose name
most witches and wizards still feared to speak. harry's parents had
died in voldemort's attack, but harry had escaped with his lightning
scar, and somehow - nobody understood why voldemort's powers had
been destroyed the instant he had failed to kill harry.
so harry had been brought up by his dead mother's sister and her
husband. he had spent ten years with the dursleys, never
understanding why he kept making odd things happen without meaning
to, believing the dursleys' story that he had got his scar in the car
crash that had killed his parents.
and then, exactly a year ago, hogwarts had written to harry,
and the whole story had come out. harry had taken up his place at
wizard school, where he and his scar were famous ... but now the
school year was over, and he was back with the dursleys for the
summer, back to being treated like a dog that had rolled in something
smelly.
the dursleys hadn't even remembered that today happened to be
harry's twelfth birthday. of course, his hopes hadn't been high; they'd
never given him a real present, let alone a cake - but to ignore it
completely ...
at that moment, uncle vernon cleared his throat importantly and said,
"now, as we all know, today is a very important day."
harry looked up, hardly daring to believe it.
"this could well be the day i make the biggest deal of my career, "
5
said uncle vernon.
harry went back to his toast. of course, he thought bitterly, un
cle vernon was talking about the stupid dinner party. he'd been talk
ing of nothing else for two weeks. some rich builder and his wife
were coming to dinner and uncle vernon was hoping to get a huge
order from him (uncle vernon's company made drills).
"i think we should run through the schedule one more time," said
uncle vernon. "we should all be in position at eight o'clock. petunia,
you will be -?"
"in the lounge," said aunt petunia promptly, "waiting to welcome them
graciously to our home."
"good, good. and dudley?"
"i'll be waiting to open the door." dudley put on a foul, simpering
smile. "may i take your coats, mr. and mrs. mason?"
"they'll love him!" cried aunt petunia rapturously.
"excellent, dudley," said uncle vernon. then he rounded on harry.
"and you?"
"i'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending i'm not
there," said ha= moaning myrtle's bathroom, "said harry.
they sat there, excitement coursing through them, hardly able
to believe it.
"this means," said harry, "i can't be the only parselmouth in
the school. the heir of slytherin's one, too. that's how he's been
controlling the basilisk."
"what're we going to do?" said ron, whose eyes were flashing.
"should we go straight to mcgonagall?"
"let's go to the staff room," said harry, jumping up. "she'll be
there in ten minutes. it's nearly break."
they ran downstairs. not wanting to be discovered hanging
around in another corridor, they went straight into the deserted
staff room. it was a large, paneled room full of dark, wooden chairs.
harry and ron paced around it, too excited to sit down.
but the bell to signal break never came.
instead, echoing through the corridors came professor mcgon
agall's voice, magically magnified.
`all students to return to their house dormitories at once. all teach
ers return to the staff room. immediately, please. "
harry wheeled around to stare at ron.
"not another attack? not now?"
250
"what'll we do?" said ron, aghast. "go back to the dormitory?"
"no," said harry, glancing around. there was an ugly sort of
wardrobe to his left, full of the teachers' cloaks. "in here. let's hear
what it's all about. then we can tell them what we've found out."
they hid themselves inside it, listening to the rumbling of hundreds of
people moving overhead, and the staff room door banging open.
from between the musty folds of the cloaks, they watched the
teachers filtering into the room. some of them were looking puzzled,
others downright scared. then professor mcgonagall arrived.
"it has happened," she told the silent staff room. "a student has been
taken by the monster. right into the chamber itself."
professor flitwick let out a squeal. professor sprout clapped her
hands over her mouth. snape gripped the back of a chair very hard
and said, "how can you be sure?"
"the heir of slytherin," said professor mcgonagall, who was very
white, "left another message. right underneath the first one. `her
skeleton will lie in the chamber forever. "'
professor flitwick burst into tears.
"who is it?" said madam hooch, who had sunk, weak-kneed, into a
chair. "which student?"
"ginny weasley," said professor mcgonagall.
harry felt ron slide silently down onto the wardrobe floor beside
him.
"we shall have to send all the students home tomorrow," said
professor mcgonagall. "this is the end of hogwarts. dumbledore
always said. . ."
the staffroom door banged open again. for one wild moment,
harry was sure it would be dumbledore. but it was lockhart, and
he was beaming.
"so sorry - dozed off - what have i missed?"
251
he didn't seem to notice that the other teachers were looking at him
with something remarkably like hatred. snape stepped forward.
"just the man," he said. "the very man. a girl has been snatched by
the monster, lockhart. taken into the chamber of secrets itself. your
moment has come at last."
lockhart blanched.
"that's right, gilderoy," chipped in professor sprout. "weren't you
saying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance to
the chamber of secrets is?"
"i - well, i -"sputtered lockhart.
"yes, didn't you tell me you were sure you knew what was inside it?"
piped up professor flitwick.
"d-did i? i don't recall -"
"i certainly remember you saying you were sorry you hadn't had a
crack at the monster before hagrid was arrested," said snape. "didn't
you say that the whole affair had been bungled, and that you should
have been given a free rein from the first?"
lockhart stared around at his stony-faced colleagues.
"i - i really never - you may have misunderstood -"
"we'll leave it to you, then, gilderoy," said professor mcgonagall.
"tonight will be an excellent time to do it. we'll make sure everyone's
out of your way. you'll be able to tackle the monster all by youself. a
free rein at last."
lockhart gazed desperately around him, but nobody came to the
rescue. he didn't look remotely handsome anymore. his lip was
trembling, and in the absence of his usually toothy grin, he looked
weak-chinned and feeble.
"v very well," he said. "i'll - i'll be in my office, getting getting ready."
and he left the room.
252
"right," said professor mcgonagall, whose nostrils were flared,
"that's got him out from under our feet. the heads of houses should
go and inform their students what has happened. tell them the
hogwarts express will take them home first thing tomorrow. will the
rest of you please make sure no students have been left outside their
dormitories."
the teachers rose and left, one by one.
it was probably the worst day of harry's entire life. he, ron, fred,
and george sat together in a corner of the gryffindor common room,
unable to say anything to each other. percy wasn't there. he had gone
to send an owl to mr. and mrs. weasley, then shut himself up in his
dormitory.
no afternoon ever lasted as long as that one, nor had gryffindor
tower ever been so crowded, yet so quiet. near sunset, fred and
george went up to bed, unable to sit there any longer.
"she knew something, harry," said ron, speaking for the first time
since they had entered the wardrobe in the staff room. "that's why
she was taken. it wasn't some stupid thing about percy at all., she'd
found out something about the chamber of secrets. that must be why
she was -" ron rubbed his eyes frantically. "i mean, she was a pureblood.
there can't be any other reason."
harry could see the sun sinking, blood-red, below the skyline. this was
the worst he had ever felt. if only there was something they could do.
anything.
"harry" said ron. "d'you think there's any chance at all she's not - you
know ="
harry didn't know what to say. he couldn't see how ginny could still
be alive.
"d'you know what?" said ron. "i think we should go and see
*295*
253
lockhart. tell him what we know. he's going to try and get into the
chamber. we can tell him where we think it is, and tell him it's a
basilisk in there."
because harry couldn't think of anything else to do, and because he
wanted to be doing something, he agreed. the gryffindors around
them were so miserable, and felt so sorry for the weasleys, that
nobody tried to stop them as they got up, crossed the room, and left
through the portrait hole.
darkness was falling as they walked down to lockhart's office.
there seemed to be a lot of activity going on inside it. they could hear
scraping, thumps, and hurried footsteps.
harry knocked and there was a sudden silence from inside. then the
door opened the tiniest crack and they saw one of lockhart's eyes
peering through it.
"oh - mr. potter - mr. weasley -" he said, opening the door a bit
wider. "i'm rather busy at the moment - if you would be quick -"
"professor, we've got some information for you," said harry. "we
think it'll help you."
"er - well - it's not terribly -" the side of lockhart's face that they
could see looked very uncomfortable. "i mean - well all right -"
he opened the door and they entered.
his office had been almost completely stripped. two large trunks
stood open on the floor. robes, jade-green, lilac, midnightblue, had
been hastily folded into one of them; books were jumbled untidily into
the other. the photographs that had covered the walls were now
crammed into boxes on the desk.
*296*
"are you going somewhere?" said harry.
"er, well, yes," said lockhart, ripping a life-size poster of himself from
the back of the door as he spoke and starting to roll it up. "urgent call -
unavoidable - got to go -"
254
"what about my sister?" said ron jerkily.
"well, as to that - most unfortunate -" said lockhart, avoiding their
eyes as he wrenched open a drawer and started emptying the contents
into a bag. "no one regrets more than i -"
"you're the defense against the dark arts teacher!" said harry.
"you can't go now! not with all the dark stuff going on here!"
"well - i must say - when i took the job -" lockhart muttered, now
piling socks on top of his robes. "nothing in the job description - didn't
expect -"
"you mean you're running away?" said harry disbelievingly. "after all
that stuff you did in your books -"
"books can be misleading," said lockhart delicately.
"you wrote them!" harry shouted.
"my dear boy," said lockhart, straightening up and frowning at harry.
"do use your common sense. my books wouldn't have sold half as
well if people didn't think id done all those things. no one wants to
read about some ugly old armenian warlock, even if he did save a
village from werewolves. he'd look dreadful on the front cover. no
dress sense at all. and the witch who banished the bandon banshee
had a harelip. i mean, come on -"
"so you've just been taking credit for what a load of other people have
done?" said harry incredulously.
"harry, harry," said lockhart, shaking his head impatiently, "it's not
nearly as simple as that. there was work involved. i had
*297*
to track these people down. ask them exactly how they managed to
do what they did. then i had to put a memory charm on them so they
wouldn't remember doing it. if there's one thing i pride myself on, it's
my memory charms. no, it's been a lot of work, harry. it's not all
book signings and publicity photos, you know. you want fame, you
255
have to be prepared for a long hard slog."
he banged the lids of his trunks shut and locked them.
"let's see," he said. "i think that's everything. yes. only one thing
left."
he pulled out his wand and turned to them.
"awfully sorry, boys, but i'll have to put a memory charm on you
now. can't have you blabbing my secrets all over the place. id never
sell another book -"
harry reached his wand just in time. lockhart had barely raised his,
when harry bellowed, "expelliarmus!"
lockhart was blasted backward, falling over his trunk; his wand flew
high into the air; ron caught it, and flung it out of the open window.
"shouldn't have let professor snape teach us that one," said harry
furiously, kicking lockhart's trunk aside. lockhart the dungeon, and walked slowly back upstairs to the common room.
ron and hermione returned in the late afternoon.
"harry!" cried hermione as she climbed through the portrait hole. "harry, i passed!"
"well done!" he said. "and ron?"
"he -- he just failed," whispered hermione, as ron came slouching into the room looking most morose. "it was really unlucky, a tiny thing, the
examiner just spotted that he'd left half an eyebrow behind. . . how did it go with slughorn?"
"no joy," said harry, as ron joined them. "bad luck, mate, but you'll pass next time -- we can take it together."
"yeah, i s'pose," said ron grumpily. "but half an eyebrow  like that matters!"
"i know," said hermione soothingly, "it does seem really harsh. ..."
they spent most of their dinner roundly abusing the apparition examiner, and ron looked fractionally more cheerful by the time they set off back to the common room, now discussing the continuing problem of slughorn and the memory.
"so, harry -- you going to use the felix felicis or what?" ron demanded.
"yeah, i s'pose i'd better," said harry. "i don't reckon i'll need all of it, not twenty-four hours' worth, it can't take all night.... i'll just take a mouthful. two or three hours should do it."
"it's a great feeling when you take it," said ron reminiscently. "like you can't do anything wrong."
"what are you talking about?" said hermione, laughing. "you've never taken any!"
"yeah, but i thought i had, didn't i?" said ron, as though ex-plaining the obvious. "same difference really ..."
as they had only just seen slughorn enter the great hall and knew that he liked to take time over meals, they lingered for a while in the common room, the plan being that harry should go to slughorn s office once the teacher had had time to get back there. when the sun had sunk to the level of the treetops in the forbid-den forest, they decided the moment had come, and after check-ing carefully that neville, dean, and seamus were all in the common room, sneaked up to the boys' dormitory.
harry took out the rolled-up socks at the bottom of his trunk and extracted the tiny, gleaming bottle.
"well, here goes," said harry, and he raised the little bottle and look a carefully measured gulp.
"what does it feel like?" whispered hermione.
harry did not answer for a moment. then, slowly but surely, an exhilarating sense of infinite opportunity stole through him; he felt as though he could have done anything, anything at all... and getting the memory from slughorn seemed suddenly not only pos-sible, but positively easy. . . .
he got to his feet, smiling, brimming with confidence.
"excellent," he said. "really excellent. right. . . i'm going down to hagrid's."
"what?" said ron and hermione together, looking aghast.
"no, harry -- you've got to go and see slughorn, remember?" said hermione.
"no," said harry confidently. "i'm going to hagrid's, i've got a good feeling about going to hagrid's."
"you've got a good feeling about burying a giant spider?" asked ron, looking stunned.
"yeah," said harry, pulling his invisibility cloak out of his bag. "i feel like it's the place to be tonight, you know what i mean?"
"no," said ron and hermione together, both looking positively alarmed now.
"this is felix felicis, i suppose?" said hermione anxiously, holding up the bottle to the light. "you haven't got another little bottle full of-- i don't know --"
"essence of insanity?" suggested ron, as harry swung his cloak over his shoulders.
harry laughed, and ron and hermione looked even more alarmed.
"trust me," he said. "i know what i'm doing ... or at least" he strolled confidently to the door-- "felix does."
he pulled the invisibility cloak over his head and set off down the stairs, ron and hermione hurrying along behind him. at the foot of the stairs, harry slid through the open door.
"what were you doing up there with her!" shrieked lavender brown, staring right through harry at ron and hermione emerging together from the boys' dormitories. harry heard ron splutter-ing behind him as he darted across the room away from them.
getting through the portrait hole was simple; as he approached it, ginny and dean came through it, and harry was able to slip between them. as he did so, he brushed accidentally against ginny.
"don't push me, please, dean," she said, sounding annoyed. ; "you're always doing that, i can get through perfectly well on my own. ..."
the portrait swung closed behind harry, but not before he had heard dean make an angry retort.. . . his feeling of elation in-creasing, harry strode off through the castle. he did not have to creep along, for he met nobody on his way, but this did not surprise him in the slightest. this evening, he was the luckiest person at hogwarts.
why he knew that going to hagrid's was the right thing to do, he had no idea. it was as though the potion was illuminating a few steps of the path at a time. he could not see the final destination, he could not see where slughorn came in, but he knew that he was going the right way to get that memory. when he reached the en-trance hall he saw that filch had forgotten to lock the front door. beaming, harry threw it open and breathed in the smell of clean air and grass for a moment before walking down the steps into the dusk.
it was when he reached the bottom step that it occurred to him how very pleasant it would be to pass the vegetable patch on his walk to hagrid's. it was not strictly on the way, but it seemed clear to harry that this was a whim on which he should act, so he di-rected his feet immediately toward the vegetable patch, where he was pleased, but not altogether surprised, to find professor slughorn in conversation with professor sprout. harry lurked be-hind a low stone wall, feeling at peace with the world and listening to their conversation.
"i do thank you for taking the time, pomona," slughorn was saying courteously, "most authorities agree that they are at their most efficacious if picked at twilight."
"oh, i quite agree," said professor sprout warmly. "that enough for you?"
"plenty, plenty," said slughorn, who, harry saw, was carrying an armful of leafy plants. "this should allow for a few leaves for each of my third
years, and some to spare if anybody over-stews them. . . . well, good evening to you, and many thanks again!"
professor sprout headed off into the gathering darkness in the direction of her greenhouses, and slughorn directed his steps to the spot where harry stood, invisible.
seized with an immediate desire to reveal himself, harry pullet i off the cloak with a flourish.
"good evening, professor."
"merlin's beard, harry, you made me jump," said slughotn, stopping dead in his tracks and looking wary. "how did you get out of the castle?"
"i think filch must've forgotten to lock the doors," said harry cheerfully, and was delighted to see slughorn scowl.
"i'll be reporting that man, he's more concerned about litter than proper security if you ask me. . . . but why are you out then, harry?"
"well, sir, it's hagrid," said harry, who knew that the right thing to do just now was to tell the truth. "he's pretty upset. . . but you won't tell anyone, professor? i don't want trouble for him. ..."
slughorn's curiosity was evidently aroused. "well, i can't promise that," he said gruffly. "but i know that dumbledore trusts hagrid to the hilt, so i'm sure he can't be up to anything very dreadful. .."
"well, it's this giant spider, he's had it for years. ... it lived in the forest. ... it could talk and everything --"
"i heard rumors there were acromantulas in the forest," said slughorn softly, looking over at the mass of black trees. "it's true, then?"
"yes," said harry. "but this one, aragog, the first one hagrid ever got, it died last night. he's devastated. he wants company while he buries it and i said i'd go."
"touching, touching," said slughorn absentmindedly, his large droopy eyes fixed upon the distant lights of hagrid's cabin. "but acromantula venom is very valuable ... if the beast only just died it might not yet have dried out. . . . of course, i wouldn't want to do anything insensitive if hagrid is upset. . . but if there was any way to procure some ... i mean, its almost impossible to get venom from an acromantula while its alive. ..."
slughorn seemed to be talking more to himself than harry now. ". . . seems an awful waste not to collect it... might get a hun-dred galleons a pint. ... to be frank, my salary is not large. . . ."
and now harry saw clearly what was to be done. "well," he said, with a most convincing hesitancy, "well, if you wanted to come, professor, hagrid
would probably be really pleased. . . . give aragog a better send-off, you know ..."
"yes, of course," said slughorn, his eyes now gleaming with en-thusiasm. "i tell you what, harry, i'll meet you down there with a bottle or two. . . . we'll drink the poor beast's -- well -- not health -- but we'll send it off in style, anyway, once it's buried. and i'll change my tie, this one is a little exuberant for the occa-sion. . . ."
he bustled back into the castle, and harry sped off to hagrid's, delighted with himself.
"yen came," croaked hagrid, when he opened the door and saw harry emerging from the invisibility cloak in front of him.
"yeah -- ron and hermione couldn't, though," said harry. "they're really sorry."
"don -- don matter . . . hed've bin touched yeh're here, though, harry. . ."
hagrid gave a great sob. he had made himself a black armband out of what looked like a rag dipped in boot polish, and his eyes were puffy, red, and swollen. harry patted him consolingly on the elbow, which was the highest point of hagrid he could easily reach.
"where are we burying him?" he asked. "the forest?"
"blimey, no," said hagrid, wiping his streaming eyes on the bot-tom of his shirt. "the other spiders won' let me anywhere near their webs now aragog's gone. turns out it was only on his orders they didn' eat me! can yeh believe that, harry?"
the honest answer was "yes"; harry r
